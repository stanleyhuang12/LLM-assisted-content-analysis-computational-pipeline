"Today we’re publishing ourCommunity Standards Enforcement Reportfor the fourth quarter of 2020. This report provides metrics on how we enforced our policies from October through December, including metrics across 12 policies on Facebook and 10 on Instagram.
Last quarter, we shared theprevalence of hate speechon Facebook for the first time to show the percentage of times people see this type of content on our platform. This quarter, hate speech prevalence dropped from 0.10-0.11% to 0.07-0.08%, or 7 to 8 views of hate speech for every 10,000 views of content. The prevalence of violent and graphic content also dropped from 0.07% to 0.05% and adult nudity content dropped from 0.05-0.06% to 0.03-0.04%.

Our improvements in prevalence are mainly due to changes we made to reduce problematic content in News Feed. Each post is ranked by processes that take into account a combination of integrity signals, such as how likely a piece of content is to violate our policies, as well as signals we receive from people, such as from surveys or actions they take on our platform like hiding or reporting posts. Improving how we use these signals helps tailor News Feed to each individual’s preferences, and also reduces the number of times we display posts that later may be determined to violate our policies.
Our proactive rate, the percentageof content we took action on that we found before a user reported it to us, improved in certain problem areas, most notably bullying and harassment.Our proactive rate for bullying and harassment went from 26% in Q3 to 49% in Q4 on Facebook, and 55% to 80% on Instagram.Improvements to our AIin areas where nuance and context are essential, such as hate speech or bullying and harassment, helped us better scale our efforts to keep people safe.

We’re slowly continuing to regain our content review workforce globally, though we anticipate our ability to review content will be impacted by COVID-19 until a vaccine is widely available. With limited capacity, we prioritize the most harmful content for our teams to review, such as suicide and self-injury content.
On Facebook in Q4 we took action on:
On Instagram in Q4 we took action on:
This year, we plan to share additional metrics on Instagram and add new policy categories on Facebook. We’re also working to make our enforcement data easier for people to understand by making these reports more interactive. Our goal is to lead the technology industry in transparency, and we’ll continue to share more enforcement metrics as part of this effort. We also believe that no company should grade its own homework. Last year, we committed toundertakinganindependent, third-party audit of our content moderation systems to validate the numbers we publish, and we’llbegin this process this year.

Today, we are releasing our response to the recommendations the Oversight Board made in their Covid-19 misinformationPolicy Advisory Opinion.
We will take a more tailored approach to our Covid-19 misinformation rules consistent with the Board’s guidance and our existing policies. In countries that have a Covid-19 public health emergency declaration, we will continue to remove content for violating our Covid-19 misinformation policies given the risk of imminent physical harm. We are consulting with health experts to understand which claims and categories of misinformation could continue to pose this risk. Our Covid-19 misinformation rules will no longer be in effect globally as the global public health emergency declaration that triggered those rules has been lifted.

Meta is asking the Oversight Board for advice on whether measures to address dangerous COVID-19 misinformation, introduced in extraordinary circumstances at the onset of the pandemic, should remain in place as many, though not all, countries around the world seek to return to more normal life.
Misinformation related to COVID-19 has presented unique risks to public health and safety over the last two years and more. To keep our users safe while still allowing them to discuss and express themselves on this important topic, we broadened our harmful misinformation policy in the early days of the outbreak in January 2020. Before this, Meta only removed misinformation when local partners with relevant expertise told us a particular piece of content (like a specific post on Facebook) could contribute to a risk of imminent physical harm. The change meant that, for the first time, the policy would provide for removal of entire categories of false claims on a worldwide scale.
As a result, Meta has removed COVID-19 misinformation on an unprecedented scale. Globally, more than 25 million pieces of content have been removed since the start of the pandemic. Under this policy, Meta began removing false claims about masking, social distancing and the transmissibility of the virus. In late 2020, when the first vaccine became available, we also began removing further false claims, such as the vaccine being harmful or ineffective. Meta’s policy currentlyprovides for removal of 80 distinct false claimsabout COVID-19 and vaccines.
Meta remains committed to combating COVID-19 misinformation and providing people with reliable information. As the pandemic has evolved, the time is right for us to seek input from the Oversight Board about our measures to address COVID-19 misinformation, including whether those introduced in the early days of an extraordinary global crisis remains the right approach for the months and years ahead. The world has changed considerably since 2020. We now haveMeta’s COVID-19 Information Center, and guidance from public health authorities is more readily available. Meta’s COVID-19 Information Center has connected over two billion people across 189 countries to helpful, authoritative COVID-19 information.
The pandemic itself has also evolved. In many countries, where vaccination rates are relatively high, life is increasingly returning to normal. But this isn’t the case everywhere and the course of the pandemic will continue to vary significantly around the globe — especially in countries with low vaccination rates and less developed healthcare systems.It is important that any policy Meta implements be appropriate for the full range of circumstances countries find themselves in.
Meta is fundamentally committed to free expression and we believe our apps are an important way for people to make their voices heard. But some misinformation can lead to an imminent risk of physical harm, and we have a responsibility not to let this content proliferate. The policies in ourCommunity Standardsseek to protect free expression while preventing this dangerous content. But resolving the inherent tensions between free expression and safety isn’t easy, especially when confronted with unprecedented and fast-moving challenges, as we have been in the pandemic. That’s why we are seeking the advice of the Oversight Board in this case. Its guidance will also help us respond to future public health emergencies.
The Oversight Board was established to exercise independent judgment, operating as an expert-led check and balance for Meta, with the ability to make binding decisions on specific content cases and to offer non-binding advisory opinions on its policies. We are requesting an advisory opinion from the Oversight Board on whether Meta’s current measures to address COVID-19 misinformation under our harmful health misinformation policy continue to be appropriate,or whether we should address this misinformation through other means, like labeling or demoting it either directly or through our third-party fact-checking program.",,,,Meta Asks Oversight Board to Advise on COVID-19 Misinformation Policies,26-Jul-22,,16-Jun-23,,en-en,"Combating Misinformation, COVID-19 Response, Health, Oversight Board, Public Policy",en,English,,,"Update on June 16, 2023 at 6:00AM PT:

Meta has worked with NCMEC to expand Take It Down to more languages. Millions more teens around the world will now be able to more easily use Take It Down to take back control of their intimate images and help prevent them from spreading online.
Originally published on February 27, 2023 at 6:00AM PT:
Today, we’re announcing that Instagram and Facebook are founding members ofTake It Down— a new platform by NCMEC to help prevent young people’s intimate images from being posted online in the future.
Having a personal intimate image shared with others can be scary and overwhelming, especially for young people. It can feel even worse when someone tries to use those images as a threat for additional images, sexual contact or money — a crime known as sextortion.
Take It Down lets young people take back control of their intimate images. People can go toTakeItDown.NCMEC.organd follow the instructions to submit a case that will proactively search for their intimate images on participating apps. Take It Down assigns a unique hash value — a numerical code — to their image or video privately and directly from their own device. Once they submit the hash to NCMEC, companies like ours can use those hashes to find any copies of the image, take them down and prevent the content from being posted on our apps in the future.
Built in a way that respects young peoples’ privacy and data security, Take It Down allows people to only submit a hash — rather than the intimate image or video itself — to NCMEC. Hashing turns images or videos into a coded form that can no longer be viewed, producing hashes that are secure digital fingerprints.
With the launch of Take It Down, people ofallages can stop the spread of their intimate images online, including:
Take It Down was designed with Meta’s financial support. We are working with NCMEC to promote Take It Down across our platforms, in addition to integrating it into Facebook and Instagram so people can easily access it when reporting potentially violating content. Take It Down builds off of the success of platforms likeStopNCII, a platformwe launchedin 2021 with South West Grid for Learning (SWGfL) and more than 70 NGO’s worldwide, which helps adults stop the spread of their intimate images online, a practice commonly referred to as “revenge porn.”
Metadoesn’t allow content or behavior that exploits young people, including the posting of intimate images or sextortion activities. Wework to preventthis content as well as inappropriate interactions between young people and suspicious accounts attempting to take advantage of them. For example, we default teens into the most private settings on Facebook and Instagram, we work to restrict suspicious adults from connecting with teens on those apps, and we educate teens about the dangers of engaging with adults they do not know online. We’ve also made it easier for people to report potentially harmful content, particularly if it involves a child.
On Instagram, we recently introduced new features to make it even more difficult for suspicious adults to interact with teens. Now, these adults will no longer be able to see teen accounts when scrolling through the list of people who have liked a post or when looking at an account’s Followers or Following list. If a suspicious adult follows a teen account, we will send that teen a notification prompting them to review and remove the new follower. We are also prompting teens to review and restrict their privacy settings. When someone comments on a teen’s post, tags/mentions them in another post, or includes their content in Reels Remixes or Guides, the teen will receive a notification to review their privacy settings, and will have the option to stop people from interacting with them.

"Today we’re publishing the fourth edition of ourCommunity Standards Enforcement Report, detailing our work for Q2 and Q3 2019. We are now including metrics across ten policies on Facebook and metrics across four policies on Instagram.
These metrics include:
We also launched anew pagetoday so people can view examples of how our Community Standards apply to different types of content and see where we draw the line.
For the first time, we are sharing data on how we are doing at enforcing our policies on Instagram. In this first report for Instagram, we are providing data on four policy areas: child nudity and child sexual exploitation; regulated goods — specifically, illicit firearm and drug sales; suicide and self-injury; and terrorist propaganda. The report does not include appeals and restores metrics for Instagram, as appeals on Instagram were only launched in Q2 of this year, but these will be included in future reports.
While we use the same proactive detection systems to find and remove harmful content across both Instagram and Facebook, the metrics may be different across the two services. There are many reasons for this, including: the differences in the apps’ functionalities and how they’re used – for example, Instagram doesn’t have links, re-shares in feed, Pages or Groups; the differing sizes of our communities; where people in the world use one app more than another; and where we’ve had greater ability to use our proactive detection technology to date. When comparing metrics in order to see where progress has been made and where more improvements are needed, we encourage people to see how metrics change, quarter-over-quarter, for individual policy areas within an app.
Across the most harmful types of content we work to combat, we’ve continued to strengthen our efforts to enforce our policies and bring greater transparency to our work. In addition to suicide and self-injury content and terrorist propaganda, the metrics for child nudity and sexual exploitation of children, as well as regulated goods, demonstrate this progress. The investments we’ve made in AI over the last five years continue to be a key factor in tackling these issues. In fact,recent advancements in this technologyhave helped with rate of detection and removal of violating content.
Forchild nudity and sexual exploitation of children, we made improvements to our processes for adding violations to our internal database in order to detect and remove additional instances of the same content shared on both Facebook and Instagram, enabling us to identify and remove more violating content.

While we are including data for Instagram for the first time, we have made progress increasing content actioned and the proactive rate in this area within the last two quarters:
Forour regulated goods policyprohibiting illicit firearm and drug sales, continued investments in our proactive detection systems and advancements in our enforcement techniques have allowed us to build on the progress from the last report.

On Instagram:
Over the last two years, we’ve invested in proactive detection of hate speech so that we can detect this harmful content before people report it to us and sometimes before anyone sees it. Our detection techniques include text and image matching, which means we’re identifying images and identical strings of text that have already been removed as hate speech, and machine-learning classifiers that look at things like language, as well as the reactions and comments to a post, to assess how closely it matches common phrases, patterns and attacks that we’ve seen previously in content that violates our policies against hate.
Initially, we’ve used these systems to proactively detect potential hate speech violations and send them to our content review teams since people can better assess context where AI cannot. Starting in Q2 2019, thanks to continued progress in our systems’ abilities to correctly detect violations, we began removing some posts automatically, but only when content is either identical or near-identical to text or images previously removed by our content review team as violating our policy, or where content very closely matches common attacks that violate our policy. We only do this in select instances, and it has only been possible because our automated systems have been trained on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of different examples of violating content and common attacks. In all other cases when our systems proactively detect potential hate speech, the content is still sent to our review teams to make a final determination. With these evolutions in our detection systems, our proactive rate has climbed to 80%, from 68% in our last report, and we’ve increased the volume of content we find and remove for violating our hate speech policy.
While we are pleased with this progress, these technologies are not perfect and we know that mistakes can still happen. That’s why we continue to invest in systems that enable us to improve our accuracy in removing content that violates our policies while safeguarding content that discusses or condemns hate speech. Similar to how we review decisions made by our content review team in order to monitor the accuracy of our decisions, our teams routinely review removals by our automated systems to make sure we are enforcing our policies correctly. We also continue to review content again when people appeal and tell us we made a mistake in removing their post.
Since our last report, we have improved the ways we measure how much content we take action on after identifying an issue in our accounting this summer. In this report, we are updating metrics we previously shared for content actioned, proactive rate, content appealed and content restored for the periods Q3 2018 through Q1 2019.
During those quarters, the issue with our accounting processes did not impact how we enforced our policies or how we informed people about those actions; it only impacted how we counted the actions we took. For example, if we find that a post containing one photo violates our policies, we want our metric to reflect that we took action on one piece of content — not two separate actions for removing the photo and the post. However, in July 2019, we found that the systems logging and counting these actions did not correctly log the actions taken. This was largely due to needing to count multiple actions that take place within a few milliseconds and not miss, or overstate, any of the individual actions taken.
We’ll continue to refine the processes we use to measure our actions and build a robust system to ensure the metrics we provide are accurate. We share more details about these processeshere.",,,,"Community Standards Enforcement Report, November 2019 Edition",13-Nov-19,,3-Aug-20,,en-en,"Community Standards and Enforcement, Community Standards Enforcement Report, Facebook app, Instagram, Integrity and Security, Public Policy, Safety and Expression",en,English,,,"Today we’re publishing the fourth edition of ourCommunity Standards Enforcement Report, detailing our work for Q2 and Q3 2019.

"Climate change is real. The science is unambiguous and the need to act grows more urgent by the day. As a global company that connects more than 3 billion people across our apps every month, we understand the responsibility Facebook has and we want to make a real difference.
Every day we see our community confronting this challenge – from people making small but meaningful changes like recycling, turning off lights, using public transport or cycling, to those using our tools to organize for change in their communities or to raise more than $80 million for environmental causes.
Facebook’s global operations will achieve net zero carbon emissions and be 100% supported by renewable energy this year. But getting our own house in order is only the start. That’s why today, ahead of Climate Week, we are announcing a new Climate Science Information Center to connect people with science-based information, and an ambitious new net zero emissions target for our company’s value chain.

One of the biggest lessons we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is how powerful Facebook can be for connecting people to accurate, expert advice and information during a global crisis. Now, we are taking a similar approach to the climate crisis by launching a newClimate Science Information Center on Facebookto connect people to factual and up-to-date climate information. We have modeled the center and the information within it on our COVID-19 Information Center that has, so far, directed more than 2 billion people to information from health authorities, with more than 600 million people clicking through to learn more.
The Climate Science Information Center is a dedicated space on Facebook with factual resources from the world’s leading climate organizations and actionable steps people can take in their everyday lives to combat climate change. The Center will feature facts, figures and data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and their global network of climate science partners, including the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), The Met Office and others. We will also include posts from relevant sources to highlight climate science news.
The Center will launch in France, Germany, the UK and US to start and will roll out to other countries soon.

Beyond our goal of reducing our operational greenhouse gas emissions by 75% this year, we will achieve net zero emissions for our operations. We are also setting an ambitious goal to reach net zero emissions for our value chain – including emissions from suppliers and other factors such as employee commuting and business travel – in 2030. We are committing to the Science Based Target Initiative, aligning our corporate climate goals with the latest science. Over the next decade, Facebook will work to reduce carbon emissions from our operations and value chain, including by working with suppliers on their own goals, helping the development of new carbon removal technologies and making our facilities as efficient as possible.

We’re committed to tackling climate misinformation. We partner with more than 70 independent fact-checking organizations globally, covering more than 60 languages. These fact-checkers can and do rate climate science content. As with all types of claims debunked by our fact-checkers, we reduce the distribution of these posts in News Feed and apply a warning label on top of these posts both on Facebook and Instagram so people understand that the content has been rated false.
Climate change is a crisis we will only be able to address if we all work together on a global scale. We are taking important steps to reduce our emissions and arm our global community with science-based information to make informed decisions and tools to take action. We hope these efforts demonstrate that Facebook is committed to playing its part and helping to inspire real action in our community.",,,,Stepping Up the Fight Against Climate Change,14-Sep-20,,10-Dec-21,,en-en,"Climate, Combating Misinformation, Company News",en,English,,,"Climate change is real.

"WhatsApp groups continue to connect family, friends, coworkers, classmates, and more. As people turn to groups for important conversations, users have asked for more control over their experience. Today, we’re introducing a new privacy setting and invite system to help you decide who can add you to groups.
To enable it, go toSettingsin your app, then tapAccount>Privacy>Groupsand select one of three options: “Everyone,” “My Contacts,” or “My Contacts Except.” “My Contacts” means only users you have in your address book can add you to groups and “My Contacts Except” provides additional control for who among your contacts can add you to a group.
In those cases, an admin who can’t add you to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving you the choice of joining the group. You’ll have three days to accept the invite before it expires.
With these new features, users will have more control over the group messages they receive. These new privacy settings will begin rolling out to some users starting today and will be available worldwide in the coming days to those using the latest version of WhatsApp.
UPDATE: Based on feedback from users during our initial rollout, instead of the “Nobody” option we are now providing a “My Contacts Except” option. This allows you to choose to exclude specific contacts or “select all”. This update is rolling out to users around the world on the latest version of WhatsApp.

In those cases, an admin who can’t add you to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving you the choice of joining the group. You’ll have three days to accept the invite before it expires.
With these new features, users will have more control over the group messages they receive. These new privacy settings will begin rolling out to some users starting today and will be available worldwide in the coming days to those using the latest version of WhatsApp.
UPDATE: Based on feedback from users during our initial rollout, instead of the “Nobody” option we are now providing a “My Contacts Except” option. This allows you to choose to exclude specific contacts or “select all”. This update is rolling out to users around the world on the latest version of WhatsApp.

"Using our apps to harm children is abhorrent and unacceptable. Our industry-leading efforts to combat child exploitation focus on preventing abuse, detecting and reporting content that violates our policies, and working with experts and authorities to keep children safe.
Today, we’re announcing new tools we’re testing to keep people from sharing content that victimizes children and recent improvements we’ve made to our detection and reporting tools.
To understand how and why people share child exploitative content on Facebook and Instagram, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the illegal child exploitative content we reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in October and November of 2020. We found that more than 90% of this content was the same as or visually similar to previously reported content. And copies of just six videos were responsible for more than half of the child exploitative content we reported in that time period. While this data indicates that the number of pieces of content does not equal the number of victims, and that the same content, potentially slightly altered, is being shared repeatedly, one victim of this horrible crime is one too many.
The fact that only a few pieces of content were responsible for many reports suggests that a greater understanding of intent could help us prevent this revictimization. We worked with leading experts on child exploitation, including NCMEC, to develop aresearch-backed taxonomyto categorize a person’s apparent intent in sharing this content. Based on this taxonomy, we evaluated 150 accounts that we reported to NCMEC for uploading child exploitative content in July and August of 2020 and January 2021, and we estimate that more than 75% of these people did not exhibit malicious intent (i.e. did not intend to harm a child). Instead, they appeared to share for other reasons, such as outrage or in poor humor (i.e. a child’s genitals being bitten by an animal). While this study represents our best understanding, these findings should not be considered a precise measure of the child safety ecosystem. Our work to understand intent is ongoing.
Based on our findings, we are developing targeted solutions, including new tools and policies to reduce the sharing of this type of content. We’ve started by testing two new tools — one aimed at the potentially malicious searching for this content and another aimed at the non-malicious sharing of this content. The first is a pop-up that is shown to people who search for terms on our apps associated with child exploitation. The pop-up offers ways to get help from offender diversion organizations and shares information about the consequences of viewing illegal content.

The second is a safety alert that informs people who have shared viral, meme child exploitative content about the harm it can cause and warns that it is against our policies and there are legal consequences for sharing this material. We share this safety alert in addition to removing the content, banking it and reporting it to NCMEC. Accounts that promote this content will be removed. We are using insights from this safety alert to help us identify behavioral signals of those who might be at risk of sharing this material, so we can also educate them on why it is harmful and encourage them not to share it on any surface — public or private.

For years, we’ve used technology to find child exploitative content and detect possible inappropriate interactions with children or child grooming.Butwe’ve expanded our work to detect and remove networks that violate our child exploitation policies, similar to our efforts against coordinated inauthentic behavior and dangerous organizations.
In addition, we’ve updated ourchild safety policiesto clarify that we will remove Facebook profiles, Pages, groups and Instagram accounts that are dedicated to sharing otherwise innocent images of children with captions, hashtags or comments containing inappropriate signs of affection or commentary about the children depicted in the image. We’ve always removed content that explicitly sexualizes children, but content that isn’t explicit and doesn’t depict child nudity is harder to define. Under this new policy, while the images alone may not break our rules, the accompanying text can help us better determine whether the content is sexualizing children and if the associated profile, Page, group or account should be removed.
After consultations with child safety experts and organizations,we’ve made it easier to report content for violating our child exploitation policies. To do this, we added the option to choose “involves a child” under the “Nudity & Sexual Activity” category of reporting in more places on Facebook and Instagram. These reports will be prioritized for review.We also started usingGoogle’s Content Safety APIto help us better prioritize content that may contain child exploitation for our content reviewers to assess.

We are expanding our ban of the Myanmar military (“Tatmadaw”) and will now also remove Pages, Groups and accounts representing military-controlled businesses. This builds on our existing ban on these entities advertising on Facebook, which was announced in February, and the various enforcement actions we’ve taken since then which are outlined below.
We’re taking this latest action based on extensive documentation by the international community of these businesses’ direct role in funding the Tatmadaw’s ongoing violence and human rights abuses in Myanmar. This has formed the basis for escalating sanctions imposed by the US, EU, and other governments, and has been chronicled in painstaking reporting by civil society and human rights organizations. The Myanmar military has far-reaching commercial interests which are not always possible to definitively determine. So we are using the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar’s 2019 report on the economic interests of the Tatmadaw, as the basis to guide these efforts, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Our team continues to monitor the situation on the ground in Myanmar and we will continue to take any action necessary to keep our community safe.
Update on April 14, 2021 at 4:00PM PT:
We are implementing a specific policy for Myanmar to remove praise, support and advocacy of violence by Myanmar security forces and protestors from our platform.
This falls under our existingcoordinating harm and publicizing crime policyand includes:
For example, we’ll remove:

Given the evolving situation on the ground in Myanmar and the conversations we’ve had in recent weeks about security concerns, including with activists, journalists and civil society groups, we understood that there was a need for additional safety features.
This new feature allows you to lock your profile and is designed for people who want more control over their Facebook experience. It enables you to apply multiple existing privacy settings plus several new features to your Facebook profile in one easy step. When you lock your profile, non-friends cannot:

Today, we are banning the remaining Myanmar military (“Tatmadaw”) and military-controlled state and media entities from Facebook and Instagram, as well as ads from military-linked commercial entities.
We’re continuing to treat the situation in Myanmar as an emergency and we remain focused on the safety of our community, and the people of Myanmar more broadly.
Events since the February 1 coup, including deadly violence, have precipitated a need for this ban. We believe the risks of allowing the Tatmadaw on Facebook and Instagram are too great.
We’re also prohibiting Tatmadaw-linked commercial entities from advertising on the platform. We are using the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar’s 2019 report, on the economic interests of the Tatmadaw, as the basis to guide these efforts, along with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. These bans will remain in effect indefinitely.
We’ve held the Tatmadaw to the same Community Standards as all of our users around the world and have removed content from military Pages and accounts that violated these policies. But we’ve reached this decision to ban them based on four guiding factors:
This action builds on the steps we have taken in recent years to prevent the Tatmadaw from abusing our platform. Among these are: banning 20 military-linked individuals and organisations in 2018, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, for their role in severe human rights violations; and removing at least six Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior networks run by the Tatmadaw from 2018 to 2020.
Since the coup, we have disabled the Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page, and MRTV and MRTV Live Pages for continuing to violate our policies which prohibit coordinating harm and incitement to violence. We have also reduced the distribution of content on at least 23 pages and profiles controlled and/or operated by the Tatmadaw so fewer people see them.
This ban does not cover government ministries and agencies engaged in the provision of essential public services. This includes the Ministry of Health and Sport, and the Ministry of Education.
We are continuing to monitor the situation and will take additional measures if necessary to keep people safe.

Following the military coup in Myanmar on February 1, the situation on the ground remains volatile and Facebook is adapting to meet these events.
Our focus is three-fold: First, do everything we can to prevent online content from being linked to offline harm and keep our community safe. Second, protect freedom of expression for the tens of millions of Myanmar citizens who rely on Facebook now more than ever. Third, ensure that Facebook, Messenger and our family of apps stay online as a source of information and means of communication.
Facebook is treating the situation in Myanmar as an emergency. Our Integrity Operations Center has been running around the clock since the coup began. It brings together subject matter experts from across the company, including Myanmar nationals with native language skills, so we can monitor and respond to any threats in real time.
Beyond that, we’ve put several measures in place to support our community in Myanmar during this time.
Key among these is the decision to significantly reduce the distribution of all content on Facebook Pages and profiles run by the Myanmar Military (“Tatmadaw”) that have continued to spread misinformation. In line with our global policies on repeat offenders of misinformation, we will also no longer be recommending them to people. Among other military-run accounts, these measures apply to theTatmadaw Information Team’sFacebook Page and to Tatmadaw spokespersonBrigadier-General Zaw Min Tun’sFacebook account. This same action will be applied to any additional pages that the military controls that repeatedly violate our misinformation policies.
We have also indefinitely suspended the ability for Myanmar government agencies to send content removal requests to Facebook through our normal channels reserved for authorities around the world.
Simultaneously, we are protecting content, including political speech, that allows the people of Myanmar to express themselves and to show the world what is transpiring inside their country.
We’re also taking the following additional steps:
These efforts build on our work since 2018 to keep people safe and reduce the risk of political violence in Myanmar. Last year, we worked toprotect Myanmar’s 2020 election. We’ve also worked toreduce hate speech, ban certain individuals and organisations and partner with civil societyto address challenges on the ground in Myanmar. While this work is never complete, we’ve made important progress. Between October and December last year, we took action on 350,000 pieces of content containing hate speech in Myanmar, of which 99% were detected before anyone reported it to us.(Updated on May 20, 2022 at 4:10PM PT to clarify the proactive rate definition.)
We are closely monitoring the rapidly evolving situation in Myanmar, and are in close communication with governments, institutions and non-governmental organizations that care deeply about Myanmar’s future. We are also monitoring the impact of sanctions that are likely to be imposed in the coming days, and exploring additional measures that we will share soon.
We join with governments, the UN, and civil society around the world in calling for internet services in Myanmar to be restored immediately so that the people there can communicate with loved ones, express their political views, access important information, and run their businesses.
We remain vigilant to emerging trends and will not hesitate to take additional measures as appropriate.",,,,An Update on the Situation in Myanmar,11-Feb-21,,20-May-22,,en-en,"Community Standards and Enforcement, Respecting Human Rights, Integrity and Security, Public Policy, Safety and Expression",en,English,,,"Update on December 7, 2021 at 11:00PM PT:
We are expanding our ban of the Myanmar military (“Tatmadaw”) and will now also remove Pages, Groups and accounts representing military-controlled businesses. This builds on our existing ban on these entities advertising on Facebook, which was announced in February, and the various enforcement actions we’ve taken since then which are outlined below.
We’re taking this latest action based on extensive documentation by the international community of these businesses’ direct role in funding the Tatmadaw’s ongoing violence and human rights abuses in Myanmar. This has formed the basis for escalating sanctions imposed by the US, EU, and other governments, and has been chronicled in painstaking reporting by civil society and human rights organizations. The Myanmar military has far-reaching commercial interests which are not always possible to definitively determine. So we are using the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar’s 2019 report on the economic interests of the Tatmadaw, as the basis to guide these efforts, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Our team continues to monitor the situation on the ground in Myanmar and we will continue to take any action necessary to keep our community safe.
Update on April 14, 2021 at 4:00PM PT:
We are implementing a specific policy for Myanmar to remove praise, support and advocacy of violence by Myanmar security forces and protestors from our platform.
This falls under our existingcoordinating harm and publicizing crime policyand includes:

Today, we launched a new safety feature in Myanmar that allows you to lock your profile. We are constantly looking for additional ways to keep people safe and we’re committed to providing a secure platform for people to express themselves.
Given the evolving situation on the ground in Myanmar and the conversations we’ve had in recent weeks about security concerns, including with activists, journalists and civil society groups, we understood that there was a need for additional safety features.
This new feature allows you to lock your profile and is designed for people who want more control over their Facebook experience. It enables you to apply multiple existing privacy settings plus several new features to your Facebook profile in one easy step. When you lock your profile, non-friends cannot:

"Update on July 24, 2019 at 12:16PM PT:Mark Zuckerberg discussed these changes at a company-wide event this morning. Here are part of his remarks.
Originally published on July 24, 2019 at 5:44AM PT:
After months of negotiations, we’ve reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that provides a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy and the information they give us.
The agreement will require a fundamental shift in the way we approach our work and it will place additional responsibility on people building our products at every level of the company. It will mark a sharper turn toward privacy, on a different scale than anything we’ve done in the past.
The accountability required by this agreement surpasses current US law and we hope will be a model for the industry. It introduces more stringent processes to identify privacy risks, more documentation of those risks, and more sweeping measures to ensure that we meet these new requirements. Going forward, our approach to privacy controls will parallel our approach to financial controls, with a rigorous design process and individual certifications intended to ensure that our controls are working — and that we find and fix them when they are not.
In reaching this settlement, we have also agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty — multiple times what any previous company has paid the FTC — in order to resolve allegations that we violated our 2012 consent order.

The FTC’s investigation was initiated after the events around Cambridge Analytica last year. Our handling of this matter was a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who depend on us to protect their data. This agreement is not only about regulators, it’s about rebuilding trust with people.
Over the past year we’ve made large strides on privacy. We’ve given people more control over their data, closed down apps and applied more resources to protecting people’s information.
But even measured against these changes, the privacy program we are building will be a step change in terms of how we handle data. We will be more robust in ensuring that we identify, assess and mitigate privacy risk. We will adopt new approaches to more thoroughly document the decisions we make and monitor their impact. And we will introduce more technical controls to better automate privacy safeguards.
As part of this effort, we will be undertaking a review of our systems. We expect this process will surface issues — that’s part of its purpose. When it does, we will work swiftly to address them.
Just this month, and in response to the FTC investigation,we discoveredthat shortcomings in our systems allowed some partners to continue accessing data to provide Facebook features on their products. While we found no abuse, the new agreement will help ensure against such risks going forward. We will also be more diligent in how we monitor for abuse, and we’ll require developers to be accountable for the ways they use data and comply with our policies.
Transparency and accountability will be two driving concepts. We will have quarterly certifications to verify that our privacy controls are working. And where we find problems, we will make sure they’re fixed. The process stops at the desk of our CEO, who will sign his name to verify that we did what we said we would.
We will also have a new level of board oversight. A committee of Facebook’s board of directors will meet quarterly to ensure we’re living up to our commitments. The committee will be informed by an independent privacy assessor whose job will be to review the privacy program on an ongoing basis and report to the board when they see opportunities for improvement.
These efforts will occur under the watchful eye of the FTC and the US Department of Justice. The order imposes a number of reporting requirements to the Commission, which ensure that the FTC and the Justice Department will have clear lines of sight at any given point into how effectively we’re meeting our responsibilities.
Even with these new measures in place, we know we can’t fix all these challenging issues by ourselves. To address this, we will formalize and expand our efforts to gain input from experts outside the company.
Today, we also resolved an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged that we should have had better processes in place to ensure disclosure to investors of data abuse like what occurred with Cambridge Analytica. The SEC also alleged that, after we learned in late 2015 that a developer had transferred data to Cambridge Analytica in violation of our policies, we should have said more about this abuse in our investor disclosures. We share the SEC’s interest in ensuring that we are transparent with our investors about the material risks we face, and we have already updated our disclosures and controls in this area. As part of the settlement with the SEC, we agreed to pay a $100 million penalty.
We have heard that words and apologies are not enough and that we need to show action. By resolving both the SEC and the FTC investigations, we hope to close this chapter and turn our focus and resources toward the future.
Billions of people around the world use our products to make their lives richer and to help their organizations thrive. That makes it especially important that the people who use our platform can trust that their information is protected. This agreement is an unambiguous commitment to do that.",,,,FTC Agreement Brings Rigorous New Standards for Protecting Your Privacy,24-Jul-19,,6-May-20,,en-en,", Company News, Data and Privacy, Public Policy",en,English,,,"Update on July 24, 2019 at 12:16PM PT:Mark Zuckerberg discussed these changes at a company-wide event this morning.

"Today, we are releasing our latest Transparency Report for the first half of 2020.
At Facebook, we’ve published biannual transparency reports since 2013 because we strive to be open and proactive in the way we safeguard users’ privacy, security and access to information online. While our initial reports focused on the nature and extent of government requests we receive for user data, we have expanded our report over the years to include the volume of content restrictions based on local law, the number of global internet disruptions that limit access to our products, and reports of intellectual property infringement.
Our Transparency Report also includes the seventh Community Standards Enforcement Report, which includes data on how we take action against violating content across our platforms.
During the first six months of 2020,government requests for user dataincreased by 23% from 140,875 to 173,592. Of the total volume, the US continues to submit the largest number of requests, followed by India, Germany, France, and the UK.
In the US, we received 61,528 requests, an increase of 20% compared to the second half of 2019.  For US requests, non-disclosure orders prohibiting Facebook from notifying the user remained flat at 67% in the first half of 2020.  In addition, as a result of transparency updates introduced in the 2016 USA Freedom Act, the US government lifted the non-disclosure orders on 16 National Security Letters we received between 2015 and 2019. These requests, along with the US government’s authorization letters, are available below.
We appreciate the focus of governments across the globe on protecting and safeguarding people’s data, including in the US and Europe, and we work hard to do our part. We comply with government requests for user information only where we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. In addition, we assess whether a request is consistent with internationally recognized standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free expression and the rule of law. We scrutinize every government request we receive to make sure it is legally valid, no matter which government makes the request.When we do comply, we produce only information that is narrowly tailored to respond to that request. If we determine that a government request is deficient, we push back and engage governments to address any apparent deficiencies. Where appropriate, we will legally challenge deficient requests.
We encourage governmental entities to submit only requests that are necessary, proportionate, specific, and strictly compliant with applicable laws, bypublishing guidelines for government requests. We also believe that people have a right to know when a government requests their data and it is ourpolicyto notify people who use our service of requests for their information prior to disclosure unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or in exceptional circumstances, such as child exploitation cases, emergencies or when notice would be counterproductive.
In addition, we actively engage with governments to encourage practices that protect peoples’ rights. We belong to advocacy groups like the Global Network Initiative, whose mission is to advance the freedom of expression and privacy rights of Internet users worldwide, and Reform Government Surveillance, which advocates for government data requests to be rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, subject to strong oversight and protective of end-to-end encryption.
We do not provide governments with direct access or “back doors” to people’s information. We believe that intentionally weakening our services in this way would undermine the security necessary to protect our users. In addition, we would challenge any order that sought to have us redesign our systems to undermine the encryption we provide to protect people’s data. We would also challenge any attempt to gag us from disclosing the existence of such an order and our efforts to fight it.
When content is reported as violating local law, but doesn’t go against our Community Standards, we may limit access to that content in the country where it is allegedly illegal. During this reporting period, the volume of content restrictions based on local law increased globally 40% from 15,826 to 22,120. The increase was in part related to COVID-related restrictions.

At Facebook, we’ve published biannual transparency reports since 2013 because we strive to be open and proactive in the way we safeguard users’ privacy, security and access to information online. While our initial reports focused on the nature and extent of government requests we receive for user data, we have expanded our report over the years to include the volume of content restrictions based on local law, the number of global internet disruptions that limit access to our products, and reports of intellectual property infringement.
Our Transparency Report also includes the seventh Community Standards Enforcement Report, which includes data on how we take action against violating content across our platforms.
During the first six months of 2020,government requests for user dataincreased by 23% from 140,875 to 173,592. Of the total volume, the US continues to submit the largest number of requests, followed by India, Germany, France, and the UK.
In the US, we received 61,528 requests, an increase of 20% compared to the second half of 2019.  For US requests, non-disclosure orders prohibiting Facebook from notifying the user remained flat at 67% in the first half of 2020.  In addition, as a result of transparency updates introduced in the 2016 USA Freedom Act, the US government lifted the non-disclosure orders on 16 National Security Letters we received between 2015 and 2019. These requests, along with the US government’s authorization letters, are available below.
We appreciate the focus of governments across the globe on protecting and safeguarding people’s data, including in the US and Europe, and we work hard to do our part. We comply with government requests for user information only where we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. In addition, we assess whether a request is consistent with internationally recognized standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free expression and the rule of law. We scrutinize every government request we receive to make sure it is legally valid, no matter which government makes the request.When we do comply, we produce only information that is narrowly tailored to respond to that request. If we determine that a government request is deficient, we push back and engage governments to address any apparent deficiencies. Where appropriate, we will legally challenge deficient requests.
We encourage governmental entities to submit only requests that are necessary, proportionate, specific, and strictly compliant with applicable laws, bypublishing guidelines for government requests. We also believe that people have a right to know when a government requests their data and it is ourpolicyto notify people who use our service of requests for their information prior to disclosure unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or in exceptional circumstances, such as child exploitation cases, emergencies or when notice would be counterproductive.
In addition, we actively engage with governments to encourage practices that protect peoples’ rights. We belong to advocacy groups like the Global Network Initiative, whose mission is to advance the freedom of expression and privacy rights of Internet users worldwide, and Reform Government Surveillance, which advocates for government data requests to be rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, subject to strong oversight and protective of end-to-end encryption.
We do not provide governments with direct access or “back doors” to people’s information. We believe that intentionally weakening our services in this way would undermine the security necessary to protect our users. In addition, we would challenge any order that sought to have us redesign our systems to undermine the encryption we provide to protect people’s data. We would also challenge any attempt to gag us from disclosing the existence of such an order and our efforts to fight it.
When content is reported as violating local law, but doesn’t go against our Community Standards, we may limit access to that content in the country where it is allegedly illegal. During this reporting period, the volume of content restrictions based on local law increased globally 40% from 15,826 to 22,120. The increase was in part related to COVID-related restrictions.

"The most frequently asked questions we receive are about Facebook’s efforts to stop the spread of misinformation, prevent election interference, and protect people’s privacy.
Although we didn’t do enough to anticipate some of these risks, we’ve now made fundamental changes. This past year we’ve invested record amounts in keeping people safe and strengthening our defenses against abuse. We’ve also provided people with far more control over their information and more transparency into our policies, operations and ads.
As we begin a new year, we want to share the steps we’ve already taken in five key areas. We still face legitimate scrutiny, but we’re not the same company we were even a year ago, and we’re determined to do more to keep people safe across our services.

Battling Election Interference and Misinformation
In 2016, foreign actors interfered with elections by spreading false information and sowing division between people with different views. Now that we better understand this threat, we’ve built defenses against it — and we’re working to stay a step ahead.
Our tactics includeblocking and removing fake accounts; finding andremoving bad actors;limiting the spread of false news and misinformation; and bringing unprecedentedtransparency to political advertising. We’ve also improved our machine learning capabilities, which allow us to be more effective in finding and removing violating behavior. These technology advances help us better identify and block bad activity, while our expert investigators manually detect more sophisticated networks.
As a result, we’re making real progress. We remove millions of fake accounts a day, stopping them from ever engaging in the type of coordinated information campaigns often used to interfere with elections. And we’ve improved rapid response efforts across our teams. Last year, we removed thousands of Pages, groups and accounts involved incoordinated inauthentic behavior. With each election, we get better.
Meanwhile, we’re working far more closely with governments, outside experts and other companies. Just 48 hours before the US midterm elections, for example, we received a tip from the FBI which allowed us to quickly take downa coordinated effortby foreign entities. Just recently we announced a new partnership with German Federal Office for Information Security, which we worked closely with during the 2017 elections there. Together we’re creating a new Integrity and Security Initiative to help guide policymaking in Germany and across the EU on election interference.
While misinformation is a common tool of election interference, bad actors also use fake news for other reasons — especially to make money by tricking people into clicking on something. Whatever the motivation,we’re cracking down. When something is rated “false” by a fact-checker, we’re able to reduce future impressions of that content by an average of 80%.Independent studies also show significant improvement. Le Monde found engagement with “unreliable or dubious sites” has halved in France since 2015. Two US-based academic institutions both found that engagement with false news content has declined by half since 2016.
There’s more to do. Security is an arms race. But we’re committed to the fight.

Strengthening Privacy and Protecting People’s Information
When people add information to their profile, upload a photo, or use Facebook to log into another app, they’re entrusting us with their information. We have a deep responsibility to protect it, and we know we didn’t do a good enough job securing our platform in the past. In 2014 we significantly reduced the amount of information apps on Facebook can access. We’ve investigated thousands of apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform policy in 2014. As a result we suspended more than 400 apps that violated our policies. To better safeguard people’s information, we grew the size of our security team and established a dedicated Privacy and Data Use team to focus on building stronger protections and giving people more control over their data. We also published ourprivacy principlesso people know how we approach privacy and can hold us accountable.
Strengthening privacy also means giving people greater control over what they share. Last year we made our privacy settingseasier to findand rolled out GDPR-style controlsaround the world.As part of this, we asked people to review what personal information they share and what data they want us to use for ad targeting. We also builtbetter toolsfor people to access and download their data. This year we’re continuing to build more controls, includingClear History, which will let people see the information we receive from the apps and websites they use, and then decide whether to clear it from their account. We’ll continue working to explain more about how data is used on Facebook and give more control and transparency over the information people share.

Prioritizing Safety and Well-Being
It’s on us to make sure people feel safe by keeping harmful, hateful and exploitative material off our services. Over the past two years, we’ve invested heavily intechnology and peopleto more effectively remove this bad content. We now haveover 30,000 peopleworking on safety and security — about half of whom are content reviewers working out of 20 offices around the world. Thanks to their work, along with our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, we’ve made big strides in finding and removing content that goes against ourCommunity Standards.
We’re now detecting 99% of terrorist related content before it’s reported, 97% of violence and graphic content, and 96% of nudity. We regularly share our latest enforcement numbers and more in ourEnforcement Report.
We’re also making it easier for people to report content that they think breaks our rules. For instance, we’ve expanded our reporting tools to allow people to report when someoneelseis being bullied or harassed. This is an important change because victims of bullying aren’t always privy to what’s being said or shared about them. We’ve also introduced a way for people to appeal decisions on bullying and harassment cases, so you can now ask for a second review if you think we made a mistake by not taking down reported content.
Beyond enforcing our standards, we’ve updated our policies to better protect the people and communities who use our services. Last year, for instance, weupdatedour policy against credible violence to include misinformation that has the potential to contribute to imminent violence or physical harm. This is a particularly important change in countries like Myanmar where people have used our platform to share fake news meant to foment division and incite violence. Myanmar — and countries around the world where some people seek to weaponize our platform — remain a huge area of concern for us. But we’re now taking a more proactive role at addressing our responsibility. We’ve hired more language-specific content reviewers, banned individuals and organizations that have broken our rules, and built new technology to make it easier for people to report violating content and for us to catch it proactively.
Making sure we’re having a positive impact also means supporting people’s well-being. We want to make sure people have the power to decide when and how they engage with our services. To do this, we worked with leading mental health experts, organizations and academics tolaunch dashboardsin both Facebook and Instagram that track the amount of time spent on each app. The aim here is to give people more insight into how they spend their time. We’ve also built tools that help people control what they see on our services, so they can see more posts, photos and videos that they want to see, and avoid those they don’t.
We’ve improved News Feed quality to show people themost relevant postswith features likeSee First,Hide,Unfollow, andKeyword Snooze. And on Instagram, we launchedpowerful toolsto proactively care for the community — like the “You’re All Caught Up” message in Feed, keyword filtering, sensitivity screens, and offensive comment and bullying filters.
We still have a lot of work to do when it comes to enforcing our Community Standards and keeping our community safe — but we’ve made several steps in the right direction.

Giving People More Information About the Ads They See
In the past year we’ve committed to bringing greater transparency to the ads people see on Facebook. This is particularly true with ads related to politics. All political ads on Facebook and Instagram in the US must now be labeled – including a “paid for by” disclosure from the advertiser. We also launched asearchable archive for political contentthat houses these ads for up to seven years. We’ve since expanded this feature to Brazil and the UK, and will soon in India.
Beyond political and issue ads, people cannow see every ad a Page is running— even if the person wasn’t targeted. People can also filter ads by country and they can report an ad to us.
The vast majority of ads are run by legitimate businesses and organizations. But bad actors can misuse ads too. By shining a light on all ads and the Pages that run them, we’ll make it easier to root out abuse.
Finally, we introducednew policiesrequiring advertisers to specify the origin of their audience’s information when they bring a customer list to us.

Seeking Effective Regulation
Several members of Congress argue that we need more regulation of the internet. We agree. As Mark Zuckerberg testified last year, we welcome smart legislation and will work with lawmakers to achieve it.
We don’t want an internet that is out of control. That’s bad for us and bad for everyone. Effective legislation, we think, should reflect the need to strike balances between competing tensions. How do you reduce hate speech while protecting free expression? How do you protect privacy while promoting innovation? How do legislators maintain control without diminishing the global competitiveness of the tech sector?
As lawmakers around the world debate the right path, we’re moving forward on several fronts. As we mentioned above, we’ve introduced consistent privacy choices around the world. We’re working with governments to improve the safety of our platform, including a recent initiative with French regulators to reduce hate speech. And we’re establishing an independent body which people can use to appeal Facebook decisions involving potentially offensive content. Unless their decisions would somehow violate the law, we will adhere to them.

"A New Sounds Library -- Creators can add Snapchat’s licensed music and audio clips to their own Lenses, choosing from millions of songs. Real-World Physics -- AR elements appear and react more realistically to forces of physics like gravity and collisions. World Mesh -- Any creator can use depth information and world geometry understanding to create experiences that look and feel more like they’re part of the real world, previously only possible with higher end devices, making Lenses like the below Matrix world possible API Library for Real-Time Data -- Smart and useful Lenses are easier to create with real-time information pulled from other sources, from the U.S. stock market, to weather data. We’re starting with APIs from partners including FTX, Alpaca, Accuweather, and iTranslate. Learn -- See the effects of global warming first hand with Save the Reef by Visionaries 777. Or, travel through time to experience Boston’s history right where it happened in an AR History Lesson by Yusuf Omar and Lauren Cason. Shop -- Try on AR clothing with Exodus by Damara Ingles, and imagine eating at a restaurant with a menu that comes to life with AR Menu by Brielle Garcia. Experience Art -- Interact with three-dimensional art to unlock new soundscapes in The Door by Heather Dunaway Smith. Or, visit an art gallery in AR with BlackSoul Gallery by Leighton McDonald. Play Games -- Run through a playful obstacle course hands-free with Monke Racing by Lucas Rizzotto. Or take care of your very own pet called Rocket Cat by Wabisabi. Connected Lenses -- These experiences make it possible for multiple people to share the same Lens with others in the same space on Spectacles. Location Triggers -- If you choose to enable location, Lenses can adapt based on a specific GPS radius, so experiences can be customized based on location. Endurance Mode -- This feature lets Lenses run longer by turning off the display in between interactions with the Lens. This morning we kicked off Lens Fest, the annual celebration of our global AR community. We welcome everyone to join us virtually for sessions over the coming days. We’re delighted by this engaged and highly technical community. For years, our creators have shared our belief in the power of AR and its ability to improve the world we all live in. Together, we’ve been building remarkable experiences that have evolved the way Snapchatters play, learn, explore, shop, and even make art. Today, we announced there are over 250,000 Lens Creators from more than 200 countries and territories. They include developers, brands, and partners who leverage the power of the Snapchat Camera and our tools like Lens Studio. Their pace of development is incredible. They’ve made more than 2.5 million Lenses that have been viewed by Snapchatters now more than 3.5 trillion times. And over 300 creators have reached more than a billion views on one of their Lenses. With Snapchatters playing with AR an average of more than 6 billion times per day, we want to continue helping Lens Creators push the boundaries of what’s possible through the Snapchat Camera. We also highlighted new, advanced capabilities for Lens Studio and our next generation Spectacles, and more ways to help creators build their careers and businesses on the Snap AR platform: Lens Studio All Lens creation starts with Lens Studio, whether designed by our community or our team at Snap. From there, Lenses can be featured across Snapchat, Snap Camera, Spectacles, or into other apps through Camera Kit. Over the last year, we’ve taken some of the most innovative technologies developed by our team at Snap, and brought them to Lens Studio. Features like garment and skin segmentation, 3D Body Mesh, and VoiceML have already given AR creators and developers brand new capabilities to build more engaging, realistic, and accessible experiences. Starting today, now creators can build with: A New Sounds Library -- Creators can add Snapchat’s licensed music and audio clips to their own Lenses, choosing from millions of songs.

And coming soon, creators will be able to make Custom Landmarkers, transforming local landmarks into AR attractions. All it takes is a mobile device with a LiDAR Scanner to map the area and create a 3D model to bring into Lens Studio. We’re excited to soon hand over our Landmarker mapping technology and let creators turn more of the world—from statues to storefronts—into their canvas. Resources and Monetization We’re continuing to find ways to support our growing creator community and their big ideas. A new Lens Call-To-Action feature lets creators include a link within a Lens, making it easy to drive Snapchatters to a destination like a shop. Our Gifting platform allows Snapchatters to support and send their love to Lens Creators through Story Replies. And, Ghost , our AR innovation lab, is accepting new applications on a rolling basis. Developers and small teams who want to explore the technical and creative possibilities of AR can apply and receive a grant of up to $150,000 for each project, as well as support directly from the Snap team. Spectacles We introduced Spectacles over five years ago as a fun, hands-free camera designed to help capture your perspective and stay in the moment. Since then, we’ve taken an iterative, public approach to improving each generation and learning alongside the community. Now, our next generation Spectacles (with AR display) have helped creators make hundreds of Lenses that bring new perspectives to things we do everyday: Learn -- See the effects of global warming first hand with Save the Reef by Visionaries 777.

"Spotlight shines a light on the most entertaining Snaps created by the Snapchat community, no matter who created them. We built Spotlight to be a place where anyone’s content can take center stage - without needing a public account, or an influencer following. It’s a fair and fun place for Snapchatters to share their best Snaps and see perspectives from across the Snapchat community. Our Recommendations Our content algorithms work to surface the most engaging Snaps you’d be interested in. We focus on serving the right Snaps to the right person at the right time. We do this by trying to understand your personal preferences. Our ranking algorithm looks at factors that show people are interested in a particular Snap, like: the amount of time spent watching it, if it is favorited, and if it’s shared with friends. It also considers negative factors, including if the viewer skipped watching the Snap quickly. Snaps that appear in Spotlight can be from Snapchatters with private, personal accounts, or from Snap Stars with public profiles and millions of Subscribers. Surfacing New Types of Entertainment To help surface new types of content Snapchatters may be interested in, and mitigate against echo chambers, we’ve built diversity directly into the Spotlight experience. We work hard to make sure that our algorithms are developed with diverse outcomes in mind. We do that a few ways, including by building our algorithmic models using diverse training data sets, and vetting our models for biases and discrimination. We also use “exploration” mechanisms to ensure that you see new and diverse entertainment in Spotlight. This approach distributes views more fairly to a broad group of creators. And, it teaches our algorithmic models that diversity and inclusion of different views should be part of their native function. For example, if you show us in Spotlight that you really like dogs, we want to give you entertaining puppy Snaps to enjoy! But, we also want to make sure we’re surfacing other types of content, other creators, and other adjacent interest areas for you, like creators who focus on nature, videos about travel, or even just other animals. Rewarding Creativity Spotlight is designed to reward creativity in a fair and fun way, and we’re distributing over $1 million USD every day to Snapchatters. Snapchatters must be 16 or older, and where applicable, obtain parental consent to earn. The program will run through the end of 2020, and potentially beyond. Earnings are determined by a proprietary formula which rewards Snapchatters primarily based on the total number of unique video views a Snap gets in a given day (calculated using Pacific Time) as compared to the performance of other Snaps that day. Many Snapchatters will earn each day, and the ones who create the top Snaps within that group will earn the most for their creativity. We actively monitor for fraud to ensure that we only account for authentic engagement with Snaps. Our formula may be adjusted from time to time. To appear on Spotlight, all Snaps must adhere to our Community Guidelines , which prohibit the spread of false information (including conspiracy theories), misleading content, hate speech, explicit or profane content, bullying, harassment, violence, and much more. And, Snaps submitted to Spotlight must also adhere to our Spotlight Guidelines , Terms of Service , and Spotlight Terms .",,,,Rewarding Creativity on Spotlight: Shining a Light on the Best Snaps,23-Nov-20,,,,en-US - de-DE - pt-BR - ar - fr-FR - ja-JP - ko-KR - it-IT,,en,USA,,,"Spotlight shines a light on the most entertaining Snaps created by the Snapchat community, no matter who created them. We built Spotlight to be a place where anyone’s content can take center stage - without needing a public account, or an influencer following. It’s a fair and fun place for Snapchatters to share their best Snaps and see perspectives from across the Snapchat community. Our Recommendations Our content algorithms work to surface the most engaging Snaps you’d be interested in. We focus on serving the right Snaps to the right person at the right time. We do this by trying to understand your personal preferences. Our ranking algorithm looks at factors that show people are interested in a particular Snap, like: the amount of time spent watching it, if it is favorited, and if it’s shared with friends. It also considers negative factors, including if the viewer skipped watching the Snap quickly. Snaps that appear in Spotlight can be from Snapchatters with private, personal accounts, or from Snap Stars with public profiles and millions of Subscribers. Surfacing New Types of Entertainment To help surface new types of content Snapchatters may be interested in, and mitigate against echo chambers, we’ve built diversity directly into the Spotlight experience. We work hard to make sure that our algorithms are developed with diverse outcomes in mind. We do that a few ways, including by building our algorithmic models using diverse training data sets, and vetting our models for biases and discrimination. We also use “exploration” mechanisms to ensure that you see new and diverse entertainment in Spotlight. This approach distributes views more fairly to a broad group of creators. And, it teaches our algorithmic models that diversity and inclusion of different views should be part of their native function. For example, if you show us in Spotlight that you really like dogs, we want to give you entertaining puppy Snaps to enjoy! But, we also want to make sure we’re surfacing other types of content, other creators, and other adjacent interest areas for you, like creators who focus on nature, videos about travel, or even just other animals. Rewarding Creativity Spotlight is designed to reward creativity in a fair and fun way, and we’re distributing over $1 million USD every day to Snapchatters. Snapchatters must be 16 or older, and where applicable, obtain parental consent to earn. The program will run through the end of 2020, and potentially beyond. Earnings are determined by a proprietary formula which rewards Snapchatters primarily based on the total number of unique video views a Snap gets in a given day (calculated using Pacific Time) as compared to the performance of other Snaps that day. Many Snapchatters will earn each day, and the ones who create the top Snaps within that group will earn the most for their creativity. We actively monitor for fraud to ensure that we only account for authentic engagement with Snaps. Our formula may be adjusted from time to time. To appear on Spotlight, all Snaps must adhere to our Community Guidelines , which prohibit the spread of false information (including conspiracy theories), misleading content, hate speech, explicit or profane content, bullying, harassment, violence, and much more. And, Snaps submitted to Spotlight must also adhere to our Spotlight Guidelines , Terms of Service , and Spotlight Terms .",Rewarding Creativity on Spotlight: Shining a Light on the Best Snaps,contain_keywords,snapchat,rewarding-creativity?lang=en-US.html,,https://newsroom.snap.com/rewarding-creativity?lang=en-US,https://values.snap.com/news/rewarding-creativity?lang=en-US.html,"English, American",,snapchat,4,m-snapchat-4,No,2020-11-23,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,2020-11-23,,This news release contains both [recent/upcoming] and [old] changes (will include only recent/upcoming changes in analysis),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Early last year, we created Here For You , partnering with leading international advocacy and mental health organizations including ActiveMinds, AdCouncil, Crisis Text Line, Diana Award, eEnfance, Manas Foundation, Mariwala Health Initiative, MindUp, National Alliance on Mental Health, National Eating Disorders Association, National Network to End Domestic Violence, Project ROCKIT, Shout 85258, The Calm Zone, The Human Rights Campaign, The Samaritans and Young Minds to provide expert in-app resources related to mental health, anxiety, eating disorders, depression, stress, suicidal thoughts, grief and bullying. Also in 2020, we partnered with Headspace to launch a Mini within Snapchat to provide a safe space for friends to practice meditation and mindfulness exercises while sending encouraging messages to check in and positively boost friends in need. We’ve signed on as a founding partner of the first-ever Mental Health Action Day on Thursday, May 20 alongside MTV Entertainment Group and more than 650 leading brands, nonprofits, government agencies and cultural leaders to drive people to take action to support their mental health. As part of this activation, Snap has also partnered with Active Minds on a Mental Health Action Day Filter encouraging Snapchatters to take action around mental health for themselves and for their communities. You can learn more about the initiative HERE . Since everyone experiences mental health issues in different ways, we teamed up with AdCouncil to develop the “Seize The Awkward” national Filter and Lens to provide Snapchatters with unique conversation starters that spark meaningful discussions about mental health. Read more about the campaign HERE . To help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in underrepresented communities, we’ve partnered with The Boris L. Henson Foundation to create a national Filter addressing mental health risks for Black youth. Read more about the organization HERE . For another engaging way to raise awareness and help debunk the stigma surrounding mental health, we’re rolling out new Bitmoji Stickers that are paired with resources to find additional support. Share the 'Mental Health First' Bitmoji Sticker with friends in a Snap or in your Story to spread awareness. We've always wanted to make sure that the content on our Discover platform reflects our community and the issues they care about, including mental health. That’s why, we’re debuting a new Snap Original, “Everything’s Fine,” that follows a college junior named Gemma who tries to make it big in the music industry while coping with her bipolar diagnosis. Take a look at the trailer HERE . As Mental Health Awareness Month gets underway, Snap is announcing several new partnerships and in-app resources to continue supporting the mental health and well-being of our community. From our earliest days, Snapchat was designed in a way to empower Snapchatters to express themselves authentically. That’s why we built the platform without public vanity metrics such as public comments and friend counts, and without an unmoderated newsfeed. We have always been inspired by the power that real friendships have in determining health and happiness — and this is particularly true among young people. Studies show that spending time with friends, whether in person or online, is the best defense against feeling lonely or depressed and that friends are often a first port of call for those struggling with a mental health challenge. As a platform made for close friends, we believe Snapchat has a unique opportunity to make a difference, and have built a suite of in-app resources and features to support our community.

"Today, we’re launching the third and final iteration of Monumental Perspectives in partnership with LACMA, a multi-year initiative that brings together artists and technologists to create augmented reality monuments that explore histories of Los Angeles communities and amplify perspectives from across the region. The third collection of AR monuments includes Victoria Fu’s meditation on the Chinese Massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles; Yassi Mazandi’s consideration of climate displacement through imagery from the 12th-century Persian poem Conference of the Birds; Rashaad Newsome’s tribute to the spirit of perpetual regeneration and innovation in Black culture; Rubén Ortiz Torres’s response to the theft of bronze busts from Lincoln Park, which had honored Mexican historical figures; and Alison Saar’s shrine for women whose bodies have been colonized and commodified throughout time. The five new AR monuments can be experienced at locations across LA through Snapchat’s camera. Beginning today, Victoria Fu’s piece can be activated at Los Angeles State Historic Park; Yassi Mazandi’s work at LACMA; Rashaad Newsome’s monument at Exposition Park; Rubén Ortiz Torres’s Lens at Lincoln Park; and Alison Saar’s project at Santa Monica Beach.

In 2022, we launched Family Center, our set of parental tools that allows parents to see which friends their teens are talking to on Snapchat, confidentially report any concerns, and set content controls – all of which are designed to help keep teens safe on Snapchat. Snapchat was built to help people communicate with their friends in the same way they would offline, and Family Center reflects the dynamics of real-world relationships between parents and teens, where parents have insight into who their teens are spending time with, while still respecting the privacy of their personal communications. We worked closely with families and online safety experts to develop Family Center and use their feedback to update it with additional features on a regular basis. Today, we’re announcing expanded Family Center features to give parents more visibility and further empower them to have productive conversations about online safety. In the coming months, we’re rolling out: Visibility into Their Teens’ Settings: Parents will now be able to see various safety and privacy settings of their teens, many of which are set to the strictest standards by default . Now, parents will be able to view if their teen is sharing their location with friends on the Snap Map. The Snap Map allows Snapchatters to see where their friends are and what they’re up to, discover interesting places, and view content submitted by Snapchatters around the world. Snapchatters must opt in to share their location – and only have the option to share their location with friends. Parental Controls for AI: Parents will now be able to restrict the ability for My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, to respond to chats from their teen. This feature builds on the safeguards already built into My AI , including protections against inappropriate or harmful responses, temporary usage restrictions if Snapchatters repeatedly misuse the service, and age-awareness. Easy Access to Family Center: For parents who may be unfamiliar with Snapchat, we’re making Family Center easier to find. Now, parents can access Family Center right from their profile, or by heading to settings, located in the top-right corner of the parent’s profile. Our goal is to help both parents and teens who may be new to Snapchat find and join Family Center with ease. We look forward to continuing to work closely with parents and online safety experts to help make Snapchat a fun and safe environment for our entire community.

"Editor’s note: As of March 2022, the Shop Module is now referred to as the Shop Spotlight.As of June 2022, Shop Spotlight is now available to all merchants in the US. Last updated: July 25, 2022. Remember 2015? The timeline was divided about the true color ofthis dress. We got our first up closelook at Pluto. Culottes were cool. And at Twitter, we were in the early stages of exploring shopping on Twitter with features like the “Buy Now” button, product pages and product collections. We eventually stepped back from our shopping pursuits to focus on other areas. Now,as you heard from us earlier this year, we’re back and putting more energy into testing out the potential for shopping on Twitter. As one of our first steps forward, today, we’re launching a pilot of the Shop Spotlight -- a feature that allows us to explore how shoppable profiles can create a pathway from talking about and discovering products on Twitter to actually purchasing them. The Shop Spotlight is a dedicated space at the top of a profile where businesses can showcase their products. When people visit a profile with the Shop Spotlight enabled, they can scroll through the carousel of products and tap through on a single product to learn more and purchase -- seamlessly in an in-app browser, without having to leave Twitter. We’re starting small with a handful of brands in the United States. People in the U.S. who use Twitter in English on iOS and Android devices will be able to see the Shop Spotlight. We believe in the power of the conversations that Twitter facilitates around products. With this pilot, we’ll get to explore how our engaged, responsive and chatty audience reacts to products that are emotionally charged -- like a new jersey from your favorite sports team -- or that provide lasting impact -- like a new skincare regimen. And, fundamentally, it’ll give us the chance to keep learning about which shopping experiences people prefer on Twitter. As we learn, we’re creating deeper partnerships with businesses that reflect whom we’re building for with a new Merchant Advisory Board. The board will consist of brands that have established themselves as best-in-class examples of merchants on Twitter. With their partnership, we hope to more easily address the needs of businesses of any size or vertical in our product innovation. While the Shop Spotlight is a step in better-supporting shopping on Twitter, it also builds upon our efforts around Professional Profiles, which westarted introducingearlier this year. With modular components for Professional Profiles, businesses across the globe – from small businesses and legacy brands to creator-founded businesses – will have access to customized profiles with features intended to help drive engagement and business outcomes. Stay tuned. Though we are in very early explorations, we’re excited about the potential of shopping on Twitter and eager to learn more as we go.",,,,Twitter Shopping: Testing the Shop Spotlight,"Wednesday, 28 July 2021",,,,en-en,,en,English,,,"Editor’s note: As of March 2022, the Shop Module is now referred to as the Shop Spotlight.As of June 2022, Shop Spotlight is now available to all merchants in the US. Last updated: July 25, 2022.

"Earlier this fall, Twitter employees around the world participated in#TwitterForGood Day— our biannual day of service where employees step away from their day-to-day jobs to partner with community-based organizations, working to improve the neighborhoods where we live and work. Twitter employees havealways given back. While we support programs throughout the year,#TwitterForGoodDay gives us the opportunity to spend time with our neighbors, and deepen our connections with organizations working to make lives better around the world. From meal preparation and urban cleanup to digital literacy and youth empowerment workshops, Twitter staff teamed up with organizations to strengthen their local communities and make a positive, tangible impact. We conducted more than 85 projects across 26 offices, spanning the entire globe. We worked with more than 1,300 volunteers who provided 3,800 hours of service in close partnership with 80 community-based organizations. Here’s a snapshot of how our employees spent time around the world. We’ve also captured all of it in thisTwitter Moment. APAC @TwitterSGkicked off#TwitterForGoodDay early in October when employees participated in Gifts of Joy — adopting and fulfilling wishes for underprivileged youth in the community.

For its first#TwitterForGoodDay,@TwitterPHjoined the Community Day at Cribs Foundation (@CRIBSFamily), a non-governmental organization that provides temporary shelter to young children experiencing neglect and abuse.

"The plight of small businesses makes for grim reading these days. Lockdowns imposed around the world have brought significant pain to the sector and most have struggled to make up revenue shortfalls online. And as we look to vaccinations as the path back to normality, it's unclear how many small businesses will survive that long. A recentMcKinsey studyfound that more than half of the 2,200 small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) they surveyed across Europe felt their businesses may not survive longer than 12 months. Meanwhile, in the US, 59% of small businesses surveyed in aGoldman Sachs studyreported a negative revenue impact from the pandemic. Considering that SMBs employ just under half of the US workforce1and two-thirds of Europe's2, you quickly see the importance of this sector to the wider economy. Even before the pandemic, small businesses in numerous industries were struggling to compete against the industry goliaths, who used their scale, technology and access to capital to muscle into new markets and keep upstarts out of theirs. Incumbency has therefore proven a powerful thing: it’s no wonder the rate of new business creation has been in decline for decades and is at its lowest level since the late ‘70s.3And due to successive waves of mergers, some industries have never been more concentrated. The pandemic could accelerate this consolidation, making it even tougher for small businesses to succeed. Faced with these two existential threats, what can small businesses do to compete in what feels like a David vs. Goliath world? From my perspective, it’s really all about the customer. In a world where it's increasingly difficult to differentiate on product or service features, price or quality, customer experience is one of the main ways you can stand out in the crowd. By focusing onlistening to and understanding your customersyou can build loyalty while identifying new opportunities to serve them. How? By listening. Your customers, prospective customers, and competitors are sharing their experiences, feedback and ideas openly on social media every day. And due to its open nature, Twitter is a great place to both connect with your customers and learn more about what’s important to them. Just about anything and everything is shared on Twitter, from the trendy to the mundane, often answering questions you didn't think to ask. This hints at an important characteristic of Twitter data: unsolicited opinions and feedback shared by consumers in the moment they are actually having that experience. These perspectives are unfiltered, raw and emotional, shedding light on underlying motivations, emerging behaviors and new norms. Surveys can be helpful, but they are guided by the questions asked and it can be a struggle to get people to complete them. Social listening on the other hand allows you to instantly tap into millions of conversations on topics important to your business. We like to think of it asthe world’s largest focus group. It’s never been easier to tap into the public conversation on Twitter to support your business’s growth. Social media management tools such asSprout Social, aTwitter Official Partner, make it easy to deliver social customer service and listen to customers for ideas on how to improve your products or services while gathering inspiration for new ones. From the florist to the pharmacist and the retailer to the restaurateur, small businesses of all shapes and sizes can gather insights that help move themselves forward. And as we enter 2021 with the hope of recovery on the horizon, investing in market awareness is a truly wise investment, which just might help some of the Davids out there take on their Goliaths.

"Following the horrific events in Washington, DC, last week, here are some of the steps we’ve taken to protect the conversation on our service from attempts to incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome. It’s important to be transparent about all of this work as the US Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2021, approaches. Updated ourcoordinated harmful activity policy We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm. Given the violent events in Washington, DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon. Many of the individuals impacted by this updated enforcement action held multiple accounts, driving up the total number of accounts impacted. Since Friday, more than 70,000 accounts have been suspended as a result of our efforts, with many instances of a single individual operating numerous accounts. These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service. Our updated enforcement on QAnon content on Twitter, along with routine spam challenges, has resulted in changes in follower count for some people’s Twitter accounts. In some cases, these actions may have resulted in follower count changes in the thousands. As stipulated in this policy thatwe announced ahead of the 2020 US election, accounts that have Tweeted or Retweeted associated content will continue to be subject to limited visibility across search, replies, and on timelines and are prohibited from being recommended to others by Twitter. It’s important that these types of accounts — that are not predominantly engaged in sharing this material — can see different perspectives in the open public conversation that Twitter uniquely provides. Our teams are discussing ways we can empower research into QAnon and coordinated harmful activity on Twitter. Escalated enforcement measures for our Civic Integrity Policy During the past several weeks, misleading and false information surrounding the 2020 US presidential election has been the basis for incitement to violence around the country. We took action on these claims in line with ourCivic Integrity Policy. Now that the results of the election have been officially certified by Congress, we updated our Civic Integrity policy on Friday to aggressively increase our enforcement action on these claims. The updatedpolicyprovides details about how we enforce against violations of this policy, including repeated sharing of Tweets that receive warning labels. Ultimately, repeated violations of this policy can result in permanent suspension. Deployed tech to surface potentially harmful Tweets for urgent human review Our teams are continuing to aggressively deploy technology to surface potentially harmful Tweets for human review in an effort to take action as quickly as possible on violative content. Using this combination of technology and human review helps our teams work at scale during this critical time. We continue to update these tools as terminology and behaviors evolve on Twitter. Limited engagement on labeled Tweets On Tuesday, we limited engagement by no longer allowing any Tweets labeled for violations of our civic integrity policy to be replied to, Liked or Retweeted. People on Twitter are still able to Quote Tweet to share this content with additional context or their own perspective. Blocked violative keywords from Search and Trends We want Trends to promote healthy conversations on Twitter. This means, at times, we may prevent certain content from trending. There arerulesfor Trends, and if we identify Trends that violate these rules, we’ll take enforcement action. Since last week, we've prohibited certain terms from surfacing in Trends and Search based on the following Twitter Rules: We will also continue to prioritize reviewing andadding contextto Trends. Our goal is to help people see what’s happening while ensuring that potentially confusing trends are presented with context. Fought spam and challenged potentially inauthentic accounts It is against the Twitter Rules to engage in spamming behavior, including bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity. That’s why we routinely deploy anti-spam challenges to accounts to fight this behavior and protect the public conversation. During these challenges, account owners must verify their authenticity through a variety of measures, such as reCAPTCHA or providing a functional email address. As always, while accounts are undergoing these challenges, they’re temporarily removed from follower counts. This, along with our updated enforcement around coordinated harmful activity, means some people may notice drops or fluctuations in their follower count.

K-pop fans use Twitter to get the latest updates from the artists they love; connect with other stans anytime and anywhere in real time; and express their appreciation for the music, dancing and ‘Hallyu (Korean Wave)’ culture that has taken the world by storm. #KpopTwitteris truly a global community as the top 20 markets with the most Kpop-related conversations (from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020) cover every region in the world today: WhileBTSis the most mentioned K-pop artist in every market (except for Thailand whereGOT7topped the leaderboard), the rest of the top 10 most-mentioned K-pop artists varied by market, showing the diversity of the K-pop fandom on Twitter around the world (from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020): For the first-time ever, Twitter and K-pop Radar are jointly releasing K-pop data across 20 markets worldwide. These were the most-mentioned K-pop artists (by total Tweets), most-mentioned K-pop songs (by total Tweets) and fastest-rising Kpop artists (by highest growth in Tweets) on Twitter globally (from July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020): Even during this COVID-19 pandemic when K-pop concerts, global tours and fan appreciation events have been cancelled, we haven’t seen any drop in#KpopTwitterconversations. K-pop stans want to stay connected with each other and have their voices heard on Twitter, whether they are cheering for their favorite artist’s new song or participating in movements like#BlackLivesMatter. We can’t wait to see what the next 10 years of K-pop and Twitter bring to the world.

"Just as Safer Internet Day has grown from being a European event in 2004 to being celebrated globally 17 years later, Twitter has also grown and has continued to make the safety of those on the service a priority, with each year that passes. Today we  joinsafety partnersfrom over140 countriesto mark#SaferInternetDay2021and play our part in creating a safer internet for all. To celebrate the global conversation around Internet safety, we launched a special emoji that’s activated by using the hashtags#SaferInternetDayand#SID2021. The emoji helps to unify and strengthen the conversation on Twitter, around Safer Internet Day. The theme for Safer Internet Day 2021 (@safeinternetday), ‘Together for a better Internet’ –  speaks to a set of beliefs we share as an online service: that the Internet can always be better, that it remains a force for good, and that it’s all of our jobs to make it safe and healthy. We all contribute, we all have our part to play. The safety of Twitter and the health of the public conversation is one of our highest priorities. In the last year, we have made strides in tackling abusive content on our service globally and have seen a105% increasein accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating theTwitter Rules). There will always be more to do, but we have made meaningful progress. COVID-19:Staying safe and informed on Twitter As the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to Twitter to discuss what was happening and find the latest authoritative public health information. #ThereIsHelp Expaning our policies The work we do in order to make Twitter safer, must be done in collaboration with our safety partners around the world -  that’s why taking part in#SaferInternetDay2021is key for us. Across the world today and throughout February, we will work with and support our network of safety partners to amplify their guidance, provideAds for Goodgrants to elevate their voices and support their campaigns, and collaborate together on helping shape a better Internet.Across 4 continents, we will run safety training, deliver presentations and participate in events to commemorate the day. In Europe, we will be participating in the Safer Internet Day event organised by the European Commission withBetter Internet for KidsYouth Ambassadors, and on February 24th we’ll be running a Youth Summit event to promote a safer internet for all citizens, especially young people, as well as to to empower young people to talk about topics that matter to them. Also inEurope, we have partnered withMaldita.es, an independent and non-profit organization focused on fact-checking techniques, on aweek-long course on Twitter, specifically designed to educate young people on becoming critical thinkers and identifying misinformation. The course will be available in English through@maldita_esand will be localized in Spain through their@MalditaEduca. It will also be localized in Germany through@correctiv_orgwithin the next weeks. We provided Ads for good for all partners. In the UK, Safer Internet Day 2021 will be celebrated with the theme, “An Internet we trust: exploring reliability in the online world”. The Internet has an amazing range of information and opportunities online. This year, in the UK, Safer Internet Day aims to explore how we can separate fact from fiction when online. We have provided Ads for Good to theUK Safer Internet Centre, which is made up of organisations includingChildnet International,Internet Watch FoundationandSouth West Grid for Learning, in order to help support their work toward a better internet for all. In Spain, we have partnered with and provided Ads For Good toPantallasAmigason the joint campaign withFundación Mapfreto educate young people on Internet Safety. We will also be participating in the Safer Internet Day event organized byINCIBE, specifically in the session “Favoring safe and positive digital experiences”. In MENA, we’ll be running an online safety workshop with theUAE TRA Virtual Academy. This partnership is an opportunity to educate the audience on multiple elements of online and Internet safety, ranging from digital footprint controls to media information literacy and security best practices. We also aim to create an open dialogue to discuss the Twitter Rules and provide feedback on our global efforts to create a safer Internet for everyone. In the United States, we’ve issued #AdsForGood grants to partners across the country to help people thrive in a digital world. Through these investments, we will amplify conversations to educate families, schools, and young people to support their online safety, privacy, and security. In Spanish Speaking LatAm,@TwitterLatamwill hold a virtual Twitter for Nonprofits workshop focused on Safety and Security. In this training we will discuss the Twitter Rules and enforcement, reporting channels, tools that people have to control their experience on Twitter, and account security best practices. In Thailand, we will host a virtual panel discussion on Twitter to raise awareness on internet safety and promote media literacy with our NGO partners@HugProjectTH,@EcpatFoundation, and@saidek1387(Childline Thailand). We provided #AdsForGood for all partners. The session will be moderated by Hug Project. People can Tweet their questions with hashtag#วันการใช้อินเทอร์เน็ตที่ปลอดภัยขึ้น. In the Philippines, we will host a virtual panel discussion on Twitter together with support on #AdsForGood during#SaferInternetDayto promote safer Internet and better collaboration with@planphilippines,@ECPATPh,@PCWgovphand@unicefphils.

"With each passing year, the number of Holocaust survivors left to tell their story diminishes. It is likely that within 25 years, none will remain. That’s why it’s up to us all to preserve their memory; to ensure that the horrors of the past will never be repeated.In 2017, we initiated the first ever global#WeRemember campaignfor International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It asks people around the world to complete an easy, yet meaningful, task. Write the words “We Remember” on a sheet of paper; take a picture of yourself holding the sign; and post it to social media with the hashtag #WeRemember. We hoped that – even if just for just a moment – this would encourage people stop and reflect. Our initial goal was to reach a symbolic 16 million people – the world’s Jewish population before the Holocaust. But, to our surprise, over the past two years, we have touched nearly 1 billion people in more than 100 countries. Using social media, we have fostered a community of people who have a common goal: stand up to hate. Social media platforms like Twitter have succeeded in bringing the world together in ways previous generations could never have imagined. Advances in technology have fundamentally altered the way that we consume information. Moreover, the Internet has lent a voice to those who were once voiceless. Having been born in the former Soviet Union, it astonishes me that the average citizen can now respond to a Tweet from his or her country’s leader knowing that there is a real chance it will be seen. The Internet is vast, and while it has connected the world and enhances our lives in so many ways, it has also exposed some dark realities. White supremacists and antisemites are now afforded access to the same platforms as the influencers that billions of young people look to for the latest in fashion and pop culture trends. Although these are serious online threats, they pale in comparison to the threats that Jewish communities around the world face to their physical security from ideological extremists. In the past few years alone, there have been violent attacks against Jews in France, Bulgaria, Belgium, Denmark, and the United States, to name just a few. The recent attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed the lives of 11 people, is just the latest example of how radicalism and ignorance can have a tragic impact. Much of this rise in antisemitismcan be attributed toa decline in or complete lack of Holocaust education in schools. We must find new ways to reach young people so they will be able to learn the lessons of history’s greatest tragedy. Educational seminars and remembrance events are no longer enough. Shockingly,nearly a third of allAmericans and more than 4-in-10 Millennials believe that substantially less than 6 million Jews were killed (two million or fewer) during the Holocaust. Even more troubling, there were more than 40,000 concentration camps and ghettos during the Holocaust and almost half of Americans (45 percent) cannot name a single one. Through our #WeRemember campaign andwww.AboutHolocaust.org, created in partnership with UNESCO, we are taking steps toward filling the glaring hole in Holocaust education around the world. A key component of the campaign is the sharing of personal stories of Holocaust survivors. Today, thanks to Twitter, we will be holding an event @TwitterNYC to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. We will hear fromToby Levy, a courageous woman who survived the Holocaust in hiding thanks to the kindness of an average citizen who stood up to the Nazis’ hate. We are committed to ensuring that lessons of Toby’s story are not lost to history. Twitter Director of Policy & Philanthropy in the US and Canada Carlos Monjehighlighted Twitter’s commitment to commemorating this important partnership, “Partnering with World Jewish Congress on the #WeRemember campaign helps us to underscore the power of Twitter in sharing the lessons of the Holocaust to fight xenophobia, genocide, and all forms of discrimination. We have an important role to amplify counternarratives to hate.” The World Jewish Congress believes it is up to social media users around the globe to set the tone.

"In March, we introducedour new approachto improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter. One important issue we’ve been working to address is what some might refer to as “trolls.” Some troll-like behavior is fun, good, and humorous. What we’re talking about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter, particularly in communal areas like conversations and search. Some of these accounts and Tweets violate our policies, and, in those cases, we take action on them. Others don’t but are behaving in ways that distort the conversation. To put this in context, fewer than 1% of accounts make up the majority of accounts reported for abuse, but a lot of what’s reported does not violate our rules. While still a small overall number, these accounts have a disproportionately large – and negative – impact on people’s experience on Twitter. The challenge for us has been: how can we proactively address these disruptive behaviors that do not violate our policies but negatively impact the health of the conversation? A new approach Today, we use policies, human review processes, and machine learning to help us determine how Tweets are organized and presented in communal places like conversations and search. Now, we’re tackling issues of behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation in those areas by integrating new behavioral signals into how Tweets are presented. By using new tools to address this conduct from a behavioral perspective, we’re able to improve the health of the conversation, and everyone’s experience on Twitter, without waiting for people who use Twitter to report potential issues to us. There are many new signals we’re taking in, most of which are not visible externally. Just a few examples include if an account has not confirmed their email address, if the same person signs up for multiple accounts simultaneously, accounts that repeatedly Tweet and mention accounts that don’t follow them, or behavior that might indicate a coordinated attack. We’re also looking at how accounts are connected to those that violate our rules and how they interact with each other. These signals will now be considered in how we organize and present content in communal areas like conversation and search. Because this content doesn’t violate our policies, it will remain on Twitter, and will be available if you click on “Show more replies” or choose to see everything in your search setting. The result is that people contributing to the healthy conversation will be more visible in conversations and search. Results In our early testing in markets around the world, we’ve already seen this new approach have a positive impact, resulting in a 4% drop in abuse reports from search and 8% fewer abuse reports from conversations. That means fewer people are seeing Tweets that disrupt their experience on Twitter. Our work is far from done. This is only one part of our work to improve the health of the conversation and to make everyone’s Twitter experience better. This technology and our team will learn over time and will make mistakes. There will be false positives and things that we miss; our goal is to learn fast and make our processes and tools smarter. We’ll continue to be open and honest about the mistakes we make and the progress we are making. We’re encouraged by the results we’ve seen so far, but also recognize that this is just one step on a much longer journey to improve the overall health of our service and your experience on it.",,,, Serving healthy conversation ,"Tuesday, 15 May 2018",,,,en-en,,en,English,,,"In March, we introducedour new approachto improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter.

"This blog was updated on November 18, 2020, to share additional ways we’re working to keep people safe when using Fleets. Twitter’s purpose is to serve the public conversation – it’s where you go to see what's happening and talk about it. But some of you tell us that Tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there's so much pressure to rack up Retweets and Likes. That’s why, unfortunately, there are so many 🔥 Tweets left in drafts! To help people feel more comfortable, we've been working on a lower pressure way for people to talk about what’s happening. Today, we're launching Fleets so everyone can easily join the conversation in a new way – with their fleeting thoughts. Fleets are for sharing momentary thoughts – they help start conversations and only stick around for 24 hours. Through our tests in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea, we learned Fleets helped people feel more comfortable joining the conversation – we saw people with Fleets talk more on Twitter. Those new to Twitter found Fleets to be an easier way to share what's on their mind. Because they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings. These are early findings from our tests and we’re excited to learn more about how Fleets are used by you. You can Fleet text, reactions to Tweets, photos or videos and customize your Fleets with various background and text options. To share a Tweet in a Fleet tap the “Share” icon at the bottom of the Tweet and then tap, “Share in Fleet.” Then, add what you think about it with some text or emojis. Soon, stickers and live broadcasting will be available in Fleets. Your followers can see your Fleets at the top of their home timeline. Anyone who can see your full profile can see your Fleets there too. Also, anyone who can send you a Direct Message can reply to your Fleets. If you want to reply to a Fleet, tap on it to send a Direct Message or emoji reaction to the author; replying or reacting to a Fleet starts a conversation in your Direct Messages. Fleet authors can see who views their Fleets, including accounts with protected Tweets, by clicking into their Fleets and tapping on the ‘Seen By’ text at the bottom. Learn more about how Fleets workhere. Fleets will be updated over time with new features, based on your feedback. Just like Tweets, Fleets must follow theTwitter Rules. To report a Fleet, tap the ‘v’ icon at the top of a Fleet; you can also mute the account posting the Fleet from here. We’ll take action if a reported Tweet breaks our rules. If you Fleet a Tweet with a label or warning, it will carry over to Fleets. In some cases, you may need to tap through a warning before you’re able to view a Fleet. This format may sound familiar to you! We’ve learned that some people feel more comfortable joining conversations on Twitter with this ephemeral format, so what they’re saying lives just for a moment in time. In the coming days, everyone globally will have Fleets on Twitter for iOS and Android. Fleet or @ us with what you think!",,,,Fleets: a new way to join the conversation,"Tuesday, 17 November 2020",,,,en-en,,en,English,,,"This blog was updated on November 18, 2020, to share additional ways we’re working to keep people safe when using Fleets. Twitter’s purpose is to serve the public conversation – it’s where you go to see what's happening and talk about it. But some of you tell us that Tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there's so much pressure to rack up Retweets and Likes. That’s why, unfortunately, there are so many 🔥 Tweets left in drafts! To help people feel more comfortable, we've been working on a lower pressure way for people to talk about what’s happening. Today, we're launching Fleets so everyone can easily join the conversation in a new way – with their fleeting thoughts. Fleets are for sharing momentary thoughts – they help start conversations and only stick around for 24 hours. Through our tests in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea, we learned Fleets helped people feel more comfortable joining the conversation – we saw people with Fleets talk more on Twitter. Those new to Twitter found Fleets to be an easier way to share what's on their mind. Because they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings. These are early findings from our tests and we’re excited to learn more about how Fleets are used by you. You can Fleet text, reactions to Tweets, photos or videos and customize your Fleets with various background and text options. To share a Tweet in a Fleet tap the “Share” icon at the bottom of the Tweet and then tap, “Share in Fleet.” Then, add what you think about it with some text or emojis. Soon, stickers and live broadcasting will be available in Fleets. Your followers can see your Fleets at the top of their home timeline. Anyone who can see your full profile can see your Fleets there too. Also, anyone who can send you a Direct Message can reply to your Fleets. If you want to reply to a Fleet, tap on it to send a Direct Message or emoji reaction to the author; replying or reacting to a Fleet starts a conversation in your Direct Messages. Fleet authors can see who views their Fleets, including accounts with protected Tweets, by clicking into their Fleets and tapping on the ‘Seen By’ text at the bottom. Learn more about how Fleets workhere. Fleets will be updated over time with new features, based on your feedback. Just like Tweets, Fleets must follow theTwitter Rules. To report a Fleet, tap the ‘v’ icon at the top of a Fleet; you can also mute the account posting the Fleet from here. We’ll take action if a reported Tweet breaks our rules. If you Fleet a Tweet with a label or warning, it will carry over to Fleets. In some cases, you may need to tap through a warning before you’re able to view a Fleet.

"Responsibility is our number one priority, and chief among our areas of focus is protecting minors and families.

Over the years, we’ve heavily invested in a number of technologies and efforts to protect young people on our platform, such as our CSAI Match technology .

And in 2015, because YouTube has never been for kids under 13, we created YouTube Kids as a way for kids to be able to safely explore their interests and for parents to have more control.

Accounts belonging to people under 13 are terminated when discovered.

In fact, we terminate thousands of accounts per week as part of this process.

We also enforce a strong set of policies to protect minors on our platform, including those that prohibit exploiting minors, encouraging dangerous or inappropriate behaviors, and aggregating videos of minors in potentially exploitative ways.

In the first quarter of 2019 alone , we removed more than 800,000 videos for violations of our child safety policies, the majority of these before they had ten views.

The vast majority of videos featuring minors on YouTube, including those referenced in recent news reports, do not violate our policies and are innocently posted — a family creator providing educational tips, or a parent sharing a proud moment.

But when it comes to kids, we take an extra cautious approach towards our enforcement and we’re always making improvements to our protections.

Here are a few updates we’ve made over the past several months: Restricting live features: We updated enforcement of our live streaming policy to specifically disallow younger minors from live streaming unless they are clearly accompanied by an adult.

Channels not in compliance with this policy may lose their ability to live stream.

We also launched new classifiers (machine learning tools that help us identify specific types of content) on our live products to find and remove more of this content.

Disabling comments on videos featuring minors: We disabled comments on tens of millions of videos featuring minors across the platform, to limit the risk of exploitation.

Additionally, we implemented a classifier that helped us remove 2x the number of violative comments.

We recognize that comments are a core part of the YouTube experience and creators have told us they feel we removed a valuable way for them to connect with and grow audiences.

But we strongly believe this is an important step to keeping young people safe on YouTube.

Reducing recommendations: We expanded our efforts from earlier this year around limiting recommendations of borderline content to include videos featuring minors in risky situations.

While the content itself does not violate our policies, we recognize the minors could be at risk of online or offline exploitation.

We’ve already applied these changes to tens of millions of videos across YouTube.

Over the last 2+ years, we’ve been making regular improvements to the machine learning classifier that helps us protect minors and families.

We rolled out our most recent improvement earlier this month.

With this update, we’ll be able to better identify videos that may put minors at risk and apply our protections, including those described above, across even more videos.

To stay informed of the latest research and advances in child safety, we work with civil society and law enforcement.

In the last two years, we've shared tens of thousands of reports with NCMEC, leading to numerous law enforcement investigations.

1 Additionally, we share our technologies and expertise with the industry, and consult with outside experts to complement our team of in-house experts.

YouTube is a company made up of parents and families, and we’ll always do everything we can to prevent any use of our platform that attempts to exploit or endanger minors.

Kids and families deserve the best protection we have to offer: We’re committed to investing in the teams and technology to make sure they get it.

AI Insights Ever get stuck on what videos to make next? AI Insights is designed to help spark your next idea and outline suggestions based on what your audience is already watching on YouTube.

In our initial test, more than 70 percent of those surveyed said it’s helped them develop and test ideas for videos.

Aloud YouTube reaches audiences globally, so we're bringing an AI-powered dubbing tool that will help creators open up their content to viewers across the world.

Assistive Search in Creator Music Find the perfect soundtrack for your video by typing in a description of your content and AI will suggest the right music at the right price.

"As Election Day approaches, you’re turning to YouTube to get the latest election news, learn more about candidates, and freshen up your knowledge on the democratic process.

Back in February , we provided an overview of how, over the last few years, we worked to make YouTube a more reliable source for authoritative information.

And we’re continuing to build upon those priorities.

Here’s an update on the work we’re doing behind the scenes.

Remove election-related content that violates our policies Our Community Guidelines set the rules of the road and we’re often reviewing and updating them, to make sure they continue to provide the appropriate protections for the YouTube community.

These policies prohibit hate speech , harassment , and deceptive practices , including content that aims to mislead people about voting or videos that are technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.

We always enforce our policies consistently without regard to political viewpoints and do allow exceptions for content with sufficient educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) value.

Other timely examples include: Removing content that contains hacked information, the disclosure of which may interfere with democratic processes, such as elections and censuses.

For example, videos that contain hacked information about a political candidate shared with the intent to interfere in an election.

Removing content encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes, such as obstructing or interrupting voting procedures.

For example, telling viewers to create long voting lines with the purpose of making it harder for others to vote.

We continue to stay vigilant and coordinate closely with Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) to identify and remove the channels and accounts of bad actors engaged in foreign and domestic coordinated influence operations.

TAG provides regular updates on actions taken against these operations, in its quarterly bulletin .

Help you access authoritative election content from home As you spend more time online due to COVID-19, YouTube is a destination with a front seat for major election events.

This year, most of the Democratic & Republican National Conventions will be conducted virtually.

Like we have in the past , YouTube will live stream both conventions and you can follow the coverage on the YouTube channels of major news providers.

Other key moments, like the debates and election results, will also be widely available on YouTube.

Our work to help you easily access authoritative voting-related information on YouTube continues, and we'll continue to share updates.

Additionally, we’re continuing to raise up authoritative voices and reduce the spread of harmful misinformation and borderline content, including for election-related news and information.

One of the many ways we do this is through our information panels, which provide further context underneath videos and in search results, so you can make your own informed decisions.

For example: In the coming weeks, when you search for 2020 presidential or federal candidates on YouTube, we’ll surface an information panel with information about that candidate —including party affiliation, office and, when available, the official YouTube channel of the candidate—above search results.

Earlier this year, we expanded our fact check information panels to the United States.

This feature expands upon the other ways we raise and connect you with authoritative sources, by providing fresh context from third-party fact-checked articles above search results for relevant queries—including specific claims about the election.

Equip campaigns, candidates, and political creators to show up on YouTube Throughout this election season, we’ve seen candidates and campaigns use YouTube to directly speak to and hear from a diverse set of communities.

They’ve hosted town halls, sat down for in-depth interviews with creators, and created videos explaining how they’ll address America’s most pressing issues.

To do this, they’ve used a range of YouTube’s features such as: Cards and end screens , to encourage action beyond YouTube, including links to approved crowdfunding sites —which now include ActBlue and WinRed.

Live streaming , to hold events such as roundtables and press conferences, allowing for substantive discussions directly with the audience, in real time.

Stories Community , to interact with voters and continue the conversation, even after an official campaign event.

To help navigate these features and ensure they’re using YouTube effectively, candidates and campaigns across the political spectrum receive support from our partnerships team.

At YouTube, we strive to be a place where a broad range of voices can be heard.

This is particularly important when we come together in the democratic process, which is why our teams at Google and YouTube are working around the clock to ensure we maintain the important balance of openness and responsibility.

You can read more about the work Google is doing here , such as the expansion of our political ads policies to prohibit ads that disseminate illegally obtained materials.

Our work allows us to provide access to helpful, authoritative information, prevent abuse of our systems, and enable connections with creators from a myriad of viewpoints and will continue well beyond the next Election Day.",,,,An update on how YouTube supports elections,20200813,,,,en-en,"civics, youtube news",en,United States,,,"As Election Day approaches, you’re turning to YouTube to get the latest election news, learn more about candidates, and freshen up your knowledge on the democratic process.

"Connecting our users with the content they love is important to us.

We want to help viewers find new interests and passions — such as a new favorite artist, a new creator they can follow or simply the best food recipes.

But there's one true expert in what you want to watch: you.

One thing we’ve consistently heard from you is that you want more control over what videos appear on your homepage and in Up Next suggestions.

So we're doing more to put you in the driver's seat.

Three specific changes we will be rolling out in the coming days: Explore topics and related videos on your Homepage and in Up Next videos: You can now more easily explore topics and related videos — such as baking videos, the latest late-night talk shows or your favorite music genre, and see more of what you love on YouTube.

The options that you see are based on your existing personalized suggestions and are meant to help you find what you're looking for faster.

They could be videos related to the one you’re watching, videos published by the channel you’re watching, or other topics which may be of interest to you.

This new feature can be found on the homepage when you scroll up, and on Up Next when browsing.

It will be available for signed-in users in English on the YouTube app for Android and will be available on iOS, desktop and other languages soon.

Remove suggestions from channels you don’t want to watch: Although we try our best to suggest videos you’ll enjoy, we don't always get it right, so we are giving you more controls for when we don’t.

We’ve now made it simple for you to tell us to stop suggesting videos from a particular channel.

Just tap the three-dot menu next to a video on the homepage or Up Next, then “Don’t recommend channel.” After that, you should no longer see videos from that channel suggested to you on YouTube.

You may still be able to find them if you subscribe, search for them, or visit the channel page or Trending tab.

This new feature is available globally on the YouTube app for Android and iOS today, and will be available on desktop soon.

Learn more about why a video may be suggested to you: Finally, sometimes, we recommend videos from channels you haven’t seen before based on what other viewers with similar interests have liked and watched in the past.

When we’re suggesting videos based on this, you'll now see more information underneath the video in a small box.

Our goal is to explain why these videos surface on your homepage in order to help you find videos from new channels you might like.

This new feature is available globally on the YouTube app for iOS today, and will be available on Android and desktop soon.

"Welcome to the latest installment of our Innovation Series , a behind-the-scenes look at how the YouTube features find their way to your screen, as told by the people who create them.

YouTube creators reach and delight viewers from all over the world, from dance challenges to fitness tips and daily vlogs.

There’s perhaps no better example than MrBeast , who has over 130 million subscribers worldwide and was recently awarded the Red Diamond .

Because his content is so wide-reaching, over the past year we’ve asked MrBeast and a small group of creators to help our team test a new feature that lets creators add multi-language audio to their videos.

Since then, MrBeast has already dubbed his most popular videos in 11 languages and is hoping to bring more international viewers to his main channel through the feature.

We sat down with him for his unfiltered thoughts about his experience working with us to bring multi-language audio to life: For viewers, multi-language audio means they can now watch videos dubbed in their primary language, introducing them to even more content that they otherwise may not have seen.

And for our creators, we hope this feature helps you expand your global reach and find a new audience for your channel! In fact, we found that creators testing multi-language dubbed videos saw over 15 percent of their watch time coming from views in the video's non-primary language.

1 And, on average, viewers watched over 2 million hours of dubbed video daily this past January alone.

So starting today, we’re excited to expand the availability of this feature to thousands more creators.

In our early tests with just a handful of creators, we’ve already seen over 3,500 multi-language videos uploaded in over 40 languages.

2 Getting started is simple: When uploading a video to their channel, all creators need to do is add different audio tracks through the Subtitles Editor tool.

Existing content in creators’ catalogs can be updated with additional audio tracks as well.

If you’re a viewer, just click the video’s settings to see what audio tracks are available to start watching in another language.

We want this to be a seamless experience, so content will also default to match viewers’ preferred language and users will be able to search for multilingual content courtesy of translated video titles and descriptions.

Whether it's chess tutorials, a historical documentary on Rome, or a series of ghost hunting investigations in Italy, we can’t wait to see our creators continue to adopt this feature into their own content, and for our viewers to discover videos from international channels.

"Navigating the expansive landscape of great music has become a job within itself.

With all of the amazing music out there right now, even the most passionate fans might find it difficult to connect with the sounds that speak to them and their unique taste.

We want to change that.

Each month, more than 2 billion people come to YouTube to listen to their favorite music.

With the YouTube Music app, we’ve built a dedicated music streaming experience that delivers over 100 million official songs, along with an extensive catalog of live performances, music videos, remixes, podcasts, and hard-to-find music that you often can’t get anywhere else.

We’ve taken all of that music content and created a personalized journey through sound that fits your particular music needs and preferences.

We know that no two music journeys are the same, so we built this app with YOU in mind.

Connecting the vast YouTube ecosystem, YouTube Premium subscribers also receive YouTube Music Premium, which allows you to consume ad-free, while taking all of your music with you, wherever you go, playing it offline or in the background.

This year, we’ve launched many new and exciting features on YouTube Music to help assist you with finding your next favorite song, personalize your own unique listening experience, and build a music community like none other.

Most importantly, we want to make the music experience fun.

Let’s dive in: Discovery At YouTube Music, we're all about delivering the latest and greatest in new music to our users as easily as possible! We're constantly looking to build features that will help guide you on your journey through the vast YouTube Music Library.

Whether you're hunting down the latest bops from superstars like Doja Cat or SZA or digging into the classics from your favorite legacy artists such as Johnny Cash Radiohead , we've got you covered.

It's like having a musical adventure at your fingertips.

Here’s how we’re making discovery that much easier: Easily find and play your favorite music .

Behind the scenes, we’ve been redesigning parts of the YouTube Music app to help you easily find and play your favorite music.

In the coming months, we’ll be launching a new feature on the Home tab that will help you quickly explore and listen to the songs and artists you’ve got on repeat.

Simply open the YouTube Music app and right at the top of the Home tab, you’ll be greeted by your most listened to music content, making it easy for you to jump back into your current favorites.

Discover new music with a swipe.

This year, we introduced the Samples tab, a personalized feed of short form video segments to get you to your new favorite music.

Each immersive clip offers a glimpse into the artist, the video, and the feel of the song.

Users can simply swipe vertically to experience a new song, making music discovery fun and effortless.

Find something you like? Quickly add the song to your collection, share it with friends, create your next favorite playlist, kick off a great new radio station, watch the full video, visit the album page, or even use the song to create your own Short.

Swipe into your next music obsession in the Samples tab.

Personalization Every music fan has a unique identity.

It’s that one song that connects you to a core memory from your youth like revisiting Hüsker Dü’s live performance of “Candy Apple Grey.” And let’s not forget about those guilty pleasures you listen to when nobody’s around.

The music you listen to speaks to your identity and we want to provide a personalized listening journey to reflect it.

That's where the magic happens.

Here’s how we’re personalizing the listening experience just for you: Customize your listening session to be uniquely you.

YouTube Music makes it easy for you to get into a great listening session by surfacing pre-existing playlists, radios or albums via Home recommendations or Search results.

This year, we made it even easier by launching a new radio experience that flips that model on its head.

Empowering users to create their own radios from the ground up, this new feature allows you to combine key music building blocks to create the perfect radio station.

After picking which artists to draw inspiration from you can tune your radio to suit your mood, level of discovery or familiarity of the songs, desired mood, and even if you’re looking for popular records versus deep cuts.

Control your radio experience with a few quick clicks.

Make unique playlist art with help from AI Starting today, we’ll begin rolling out a new experimental feature for English language US users on YouTube Music that creates customized playlist art using generative AI.

The guided experience allows users to effortlessly explore from a range of visual themes and options to create one-of-a-kind cover art that expresses the uniqueness of your personal playlists.

Struggling to find the perfect artwork for your 90’s R&B-inspired morning commute playlist? Don’t worry, we got you.

Stay tuned for expansion to other regions and languages globally.

Community YouTube Music’s unique combination of music videos, live performances, music premieres and short form videos, inspires real, devoted fandom.

As users, you’re the heartbeat of our platform and we want to make sure that you’re able to connect, celebrate, and share the music that you love.

We’re always looking for new ways to help our users share their favorites or a new discovery, build a more engaged community, and create a richer overall consumption experience.

Here’s how we’re doing it: Express yourself and connect with other music fans.

Recently, we introduced a new way to express yourself and connect with others through Comments in the YouTube Music app.

With comments, you can make your voice heard by adding to the conversation around a new song, podcast or old favorite, while seeing what the broader community is saying by reading or reacting to their thoughts – all within the music app.

These comments will mirror the same conversations happening on YouTube, allowing you to stay connected with music lovers across the YouTube ecosystem.

Can’t hold back your excitement from the latest Cardi B and Megan the Stallion music video ? Hop in the comments and join the conversation! The only thing better than listening to your favorite songs is being able to follow along line-by-line to them.

Recently, we launched timed lyrics in YouTube Music, so now you and your friends can follow the words on-screen as you listen.

If you’re looking for your favorite part of the song, you can tap on a specific lyric to jump to that part of the track.

So now there’s no need to be the only one at the party that can’t remember the words to “ Bohemian Rhapsody .” Make YouTube Music part of your next karaoke experience!

"Super Bowl LVIII may be just around the corner but The Big Game isn’t only about the game itself.

It’s about the conversations, the commentary, and — of course — the ads.

Brands are gearing up to premiere their biggest ads of the year, ads that dominate the conversation and elevate the form, turning America’s living rooms into a mini short-film festival.

And for 18 years, AdBlitz has been YouTube’s gateway into that world, for fans and for brands.

AdBlitz offers a central hub for fans to watch, rewatch, share, and discuss their favorite Super Bowl ads, both during and after the game.

In fact, as viewership of mass-culture moments continues to fragment across TV, streaming, and digital video, YouTube is the only place you can watch every Super Bowl ad, all in one place.

According to Comscore’s analysis, 88% of adults ages 18–49 saw a 2023 Super Bowl ad on YouTube, compared to the 68% who watched on linear TV.

Connected TV, specifically, is increasingly emerging as a major player — Comscore also found that 29% of adults ages 18–34 who only saw a 2023 Super Bowl ad on YouTube, saw it on CTV.

And it’s clear why fans flock to YouTube.

After all, the biggest leagues, creators, and fan communities thrive on YouTube.

From postgame analysis to behind-the-scenes action to game-day recipes and more, creators give fans near-infinite ways to immerse themselves in football culture.

It’s no surprise the NFL is placing its bets on YouTube and its creators.

With watchtime for content on NFL’s YouTube channel reaching 1.6B views in 2022 and the addition of NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023, more and more football fans are choosing YouTube to get more out of the game.

It’s not just fans that get more, either: AdBlitz helps brands go bigger during advertising’s biggest moment.

It’s where brands get more value out of their :30s spot, multiplying their reach and driving better results compared to the live broadcast alone.

And with Google’s AI-powered ad solutions, brands can make the most of their hero Super Bowl creative to reach audiences across CTV, YouTube Shorts, and all the other formats where sports fans watch on YouTube.

Take FanDuel, which did exactly that for the 2023 Super Bowl.

Looking to drive awareness of their new Sportsbook product, they needed a creative way to stand apart from the noise.

So they tapped into AdBlitz and YouTube’s powerful AI tools to deliver a truly dynamic campaign.

Early in the football season, FanDuel launched Video Action Campaigns and mastheads and ran them continuously throughout the playoffs.

Then, in the week leading up to the Super Bowl, it ran a heavy-up of both masthead and awareness auction media.

This helped to build momentum and drive registrations and first-time deposits.

All told, FanDuel drove over 1.1M lifted users throughout the playoffs leading into the 2023 Super Bowl.

We couldn’t be more excited for Super Bowl LVIII.

To get into the game-day spirit, you can check out some of the first of this year’s teasers and commercials on the AdBlitz channel, including Amazon , Taco Bell and Totino’s .

Also, of course, watch a few winners from last year’s AdBlitz contest, which highlights the most-viewed ads from the launch of AdBlitz to the week after the Super Bowl, including: FanDuel - NFL Training Montage Dunkin' - 'Drive Thru' Starring Ben T-Mobile - Zach Braff and Donald Faison Sing a Duet for Home Internet",,,,Super Bowl AdBlitz: Fans get more from the game (and the ads) on YouTube,20240125,,,,en-en,"youtube ads, culture and trends|experience youtube",en,United States,,,"Super Bowl LVIII may be just around the corner but The Big Game isn’t only about the game itself.

According to Comscore’s analysis, 88% of adults ages 18–49 saw a 2023 Super Bowl ad on YouTube, compared to the 68% who watched on linear TV.

Connected TV, specifically, is increasingly emerging as a major player — Comscore also found that 29% of adults ages 18–34 who only saw a 2023 Super Bowl ad on YouTube, saw it on CTV.

And it’s clear why fans flock to YouTube.

After all, the biggest leagues, creators, and fan communities thrive on YouTube.

From postgame analysis to behind-the-scenes action to game-day recipes and more, creators give fans near-infinite ways to immerse themselves in football culture.

It’s no surprise the NFL is placing its bets on YouTube and its creators.

With watchtime for content on NFL’s YouTube channel reaching 1.6B views in 2022 and the addition of NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023, more and more football fans are choosing YouTube to get more out of the game.

It’s not just fans that get more, either: AdBlitz helps brands go bigger during advertising’s biggest moment.

It’s where brands get more value out of their :30s spot, multiplying their reach and driving better results compared to the live broadcast alone.

And with Google’s AI-powered ad solutions, brands can make the most of their hero Super Bowl creative to reach audiences across CTV, YouTube Shorts, and all the other formats where sports fans watch on YouTube.

Take FanDuel, which did exactly that for the 2023 Super Bowl.

Looking to drive awareness of their new Sportsbook product, they needed a creative way to stand apart from the noise.

So they tapped into AdBlitz and YouTube’s powerful AI tools to deliver a truly dynamic campaign.

Early in the football season, FanDuel launched Video Action Campaigns and mastheads and ran them continuously throughout the playoffs.

Then, in the week leading up to the Super Bowl, it ran a heavy-up of both masthead and awareness auction media.

This helped to build momentum and drive registrations and first-time deposits.

All told, FanDuel drove over 1.1M lifted users throughout the playoffs leading into the 2023 Super Bowl.

We couldn’t be more excited for Super Bowl LVIII.

To get into the game-day spirit, you can check out some of the first of this year’s teasers and commercials on the AdBlitz channel, including Amazon , Taco Bell and Totino’s .

Also, of course, watch a few winners from last year’s AdBlitz contest, which highlights the most-viewed ads from the launch of AdBlitz to the week after the Super Bowl, including: FanDuel - NFL Training Montage Dunkin' - 'Drive Thru' Starring Ben T-Mobile - Zach Braff and Donald Faison Sing a Duet for Home Internet",Super Bowl AdBlitz: Fans get more from the game (and the ads) on YouTube,contain_keywords,youtube,70423_Super_Bowl_AdBlitz_Fans_get_more_from_the_game_and_the_ads_on_YouTube.html,Kristen O’Hara,https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/super-bowl-2024-adblitz/,,,"Vice President, Agency, Platforms & Client Solutions, YouTube",youtube,8,m-youtube-8,No,2024-01-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,2024-01-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A boy named Sasha’s first shave.

Three Angolan women singing as they work to produce corn flour.

These seemingly disparate moments were all part of the same day in July 2010.

From a Googler’s scrappy pitch to 80,000 video submissions from people around the world came "" Life in a Day ."" It was the biggest crowdsourced feature film ever made, directed by Kevin Macdonald and executive produced by Ridley Scott.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and has received over 17 million views to date on YouTube.

Now, a decade later, the same team set out to create another global time capsule: this time, with a dedicated YouTube Originals team at the helm, and more than 324,000 submissions to document one of the most noteworthy years in recent history.

(We’re talking, of course, about 2020.) We sat down for a conversation with YouTube’s Director of Marketing, Sara Pollack, and producer Jack Arbuthnott to reflect on making the two films.

Jack: Let’s take this back to the beginning.

Sara, remind me where this all started? Sara: In 2009, Tim Partridge, a former Googler, came up with the concept of a global crowdsourced documentary—at the time it was called “A Day in the Life of the World.” Shortly after, Tim joined my team, and we built out a small team and partnered with Scott Free Films, a production company out of London, to make it happen.

And that’s when I got involved! The idea that Tim pitched, of having this lens on the whole world together on one day, was very winning.

But we really had no idea if it was possible—technically or creatively—to make a wonderful, cohesive film made from thousands of disparate clips shot on different quality devices, with no guiding narrative.

The project needed a singular vision and the ability to synthesise reality into cinema.

We immediately approached Kevin Macdonald.

A boy in Omsk, Russia, reading with his pet rat, Rex, on July 25, 2020.

Together with his mother Mariia, who submitted the footage, he spends his days conducting science experiments and reading about outer space.

YouTube was only five years old at the time, and still getting over the hump of being thought of exclusively as a platform for dogs on skateboards, silly home videos, etc.

This was a big opportunity for us to show how YouTube could be used for creative storytelling, and how we could bring the world together in that pursuit.

Creating a film with Ridley Scott and Kevin Macdonald, and screening it at the Sundance Film Festival, was all pretty uncharted territory.

This definitely felt radical at the time.

It also felt really important that everyone who was a part of the film got to be a part of that first experience.

So when the 2010 film premiered at Sundance, they took a leap and let us live stream the premiere from the event in Park City, Utah, so anyone in the world could watch it together.

It’s kind of ironic now that most entertainment experiences are happening virtually, and our 2020 film had its premiere in the first all-virtual Sundance.

Jack, what were some of the other standout changes for you in terms of production? The change over only 10 years has been extraordinary.

The industry itself has transformed entirely, and most people now see films by streaming them.

But also, the way we made the film this time around was different.

Crowdsourcing, reviewing, tagging and editing down the 80,000 videos from 2010 was a complete nightmare.

Ten years later, with four times as many clips, working remotely, and with vastly more file formats, we were able to address every deficiency and create a really seamless system.

We became entirely reliant on Google Cloud Services, as we began to realise quite how much it could do— and with such delicious scalability! We used machine learning to categorize and tag submissions, and for translation.

We stored everything in the cloud.

The editors could search for anything and find it instantaneously.

Shout out to Google Cloud! Thank you for the support! It’s true! It really was a game changer.

We also used Google technology in creating the score.

In 2010, one of the composers, Matthew Herbert, asked everyone to submit a breath and a clap.

This time, he used Google AI to parse every submission we received— and there are elements of the score derived from every single video.

Matthew also extracted over 26,000 different dog barks, to create a kind of dog bark piano, amongst other strange feats.

That will never stop being cool for me.

It was also great to bring everyone back together for another project.

Kevin, Ridley, Sundance—even Tim Partridge was back with us again, albeit this time as a producer working from his own creative agency.

We also had the opportunity to add more in-house expertise this time around, as the 2020 film is officially a YouTube Originals film, which didn’t exist when we made the first one.

The 2020 film benefited from the fresh perspective added by Susanne Daniels (Global Head of Original Content), Alex Piper (Head of Unscripted) and the entire YouTube Originals team with Nicole Emanuele leading as the development executive.

And some of the contributors! It was amazing to have some of them return and show the ten year time jump.

So much so, that we created an additional segment focused on them.

Yes! YouTube Premium subscribers have access to bonus content including “ Then and Now ,” which shows contributors from the original film and where they were in 2020.

It also includes some scenes that didn’t make the final cut for the second Life in a Day, but are remarkable nonetheless.

There’s also this deep connection you’re able to build with the contributors in the film.

It’s easy to get attached to the people, so it felt really good that we had quite a few folks from the 2010 film return for 2020.

You see Taiji Aikawa, the little boy from Japan, all grown up.

There’s also some sadness; Suzanne Lucas shares in the 2020 film that her son Alex, who appeared in the first film, passed away from COVID-19 last February, at only 23 years old.

The 2020 film is dedicated to his memory.

This year, there is definitely a different tone and range of emotions in the film.

A lot has happened in the world over the last decade, and particularly over the last year.

It truly felt like the perfect time to revisit this project and let people share their stories.

Creators have writers’ rooms, production teams, and business strategies.

They’re developing programming that’s not just popular and relevant – it’s breaking boundaries.

Creators are defining a new era of entertainment.

And they deserve the same acclaim as other creative professionals.

Some might argue that broadening the Primetime Emmys to include consideration of creators would detract from its storied history or lessen its cultural significance.

But recognizing the work of creators is the best way for the Television Academy to continue its legacy of honoring modern culture, while also building a bridge to the next generation of viewers.

When the Academy first met in 1946, television was still a new medium.

Over the years, the awards broadened as TV evolved, adding categories like reality competitions and short form comedy.

Given massive cultural shifts in recent years, it’s time for the Academy to evolve again or risk becoming out of step with the mainstream.

Honoring creators won’t take away from others that receive well-deserved recognition.

Instead, it will add to the celebration by including everyone who deserves consideration in current Emmy categories.

And in the years ahead, the Academy could consider expanding their categories to cover the full range of entertainment.

The number of top creators with a majority of their watchtime coming from TV has increased more than 400 percent in the last three years.

People around the world love to watch creators as much as they love to watch traditional media.

If viewers aren’t discriminating between these categories, then neither should the Emmys.

More and more, viewers are tuning into creators who are reinventing our favorite genres, like Hot Ones .

Sean Evans’ YouTube talk show launched in 2015 with a premise based on spicy chicken wings, and now it’s a hit.

I visited Rhett and Link’s studio last year, and I was blown away by the speed of their creativity and their strategies to respond to viewer feedback.

Traditional shows have to wait for their next season to take cues from their audience, but creators can instantly tweak their approach based on fan feedback and sophisticated analytics.

From months-long livestreams to Shorts, creators are always pushing the envelope.

"For months, we have all been focused on the development of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Now that effective vaccines have been approved by many health authorities around the world, the focus has shifted toward two new challenges: ensuring access to vaccines for everyone, and ensuring that as many people as possible actually get vaccinated when it is offered.

As we’ve discovered throughout the pandemic, effective communication is a crucial part of improving public health.

When it comes to our global vaccination efforts, building confidence and trust in these new vaccines will be the difference maker that ends the pandemic and allows a return to normal life.

YouTube is committed to leveraging our platform’s reach (2B+ monthly logged-in viewers) and the diversity of the YouTube creator community, to help make the science of COVID-19 vaccines easy to understand and more accessible to people all over the world.

This is a pivotal moment in history and in public health, and we are deeply invested in ensuring we meet the moment as the platform where the world comes to watch and learn.

We will do this in three ways: First, we’ll continue to raise up authoritative information from Local Health Authorities and community-based health organizations.

Second, we are investing in a new, multimillion-dollar campaign to address vaccine hesitancy in countries around the world.

And lastly, we will build on our success to-date in connecting our creators with trusted health experts to reimagine how vaccine information is shared.

Highly visible information from local health authorities Since March 2020, we have worked closely with more than 85 local health authorities and public health experts across the world, and have created highly visible methods of sharing information from public health authorities across YouTube.

We’re continuing these efforts as the pandemic evolves to share information about the development, safety and efficacy of the vaccines.

All of this is making an impact -- our authoritative partner content and COVID-19 information panels on YouTube have been viewed 400B times, making them an important source of authoritative information.

In addition to these efforts to share vaccine information to a broad audience, we have also sharpened our focus on communities who are most at-risk and most in need of this critical — and in some cases — life-saving public health information.

We are working with a wide range of partners who have experience and expertise in public health communication with key at-risk groups, to help create, amplify and promote their campaigns on YouTube, including the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Greater Than COVID video campaign, featuring their series for Black America and two upcoming series that seek to reach both the Latinx community and low-income rural communities across America; and the Black Coalition Against COVID-19 and Black Doctor Org video series to help answer top questions from the Black community about COVID and vaccines.

New campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy We’re excited to share today that we will be working with the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine towards an upcoming global campaign that will feature the personal stories of people getting vaccinated and help to remind us of all we have to look forward to as a vaccinated world recovers from the pandemic.

YouTube is also working with Global Citizen on a global special , airing in May 2021, that will focus on overcoming vaccine hesitancy and ensuring equitable distribution.

Additional details of this global special will be announced in the coming weeks.

Reimagining ways to share public health information People come to YouTube because of the creators and artists who they have developed connections with, and we believe creators have an important role to play in helping public health experts to reimagine the ways in which health information has traditionally been shared.

That’s why we’re expanding our efforts to connect influential creators and artists with relatable, trusted scientists and public health experts for thoughtful, science-based but ultimately engaging and compelling videos that will answer the questions that are top of mind for each creator’s unique audience.

To date, more than 60+ of these collaboration videos have been completed, which have received more than 65M views.

We’re building on the success of conversations like the ones between Dr.

Fauci and Monica , CDC officer TIa Rogers and Asia Jackson , and Andy Slavitt and Jim Gaffigan , to connect with more audiences, ranging from rural and farming communities to family vloggers.

In fact, YouTube creators have been so successful in reaching their audiences with COVID-19 health messages that President Emmanuel Macron of France issued a challenge to creators Carlito and McFly that if they could create a video about COVID safety that reached 10M views, he would invite them to the Elysée Palace for a Q&A.

Their video , a hilarious musical tribute to COVID safety measures, hit 10M views in just three days, showing how a creative approach can share helpful information in ways that are relatable, digestible and easily accessible.

Dr.

Garth Graham Additionally, we have a large and growing community of YouTube creators who are also clinicians.

These creators are an invaluable part of our ecosystem and have large audiences who depend on them for credible information about a number of health questions, including COVID-19 vaccination.

We’re also continuing to rigorously enforce our policies against misinformation related to COVID-19 .

To-date, we have removed over 850K videos for violating these policies, including more than 30K since the last quarter of 2020 that specifically violated our policy on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.

With the effects of the pandemic still being felt around the world, we’re constantly evolving our priorities to meet the changing needs of our global community.

This is the first step in our vaccination education work with much more in the works for the coming months.

“Our work at the Vaccine Confidence Project is focused on monitoring and identifying the levels of public confidence and trust in vaccination -- work that has been brought into sharp relief with the rollout of new COVID-19 vaccines.

We are excited to collaborate with YouTube on a global education campaign to help address vaccine hesitancy and help to remind us all of what we have to look forward to as a vaccinated world recovers from the pandemic."" (Professor Heidi Larson, Director of The Vaccine Confidence Project)",,,,How we’re supporting COVID-19 vaccine education,20210318,,,,en-en,"inside youtube, learning and education",en,United States,,,"For months, we have all been focused on the development of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Now that effective vaccines have been approved by many health authorities around the world, the focus has shifted toward two new challenges: ensuring access to vaccines for everyone, and ensuring that as many people as possible actually get vaccinated when it is offered.

As we’ve discovered throughout the pandemic, effective communication is a crucial part of improving public health.

When it comes to our global vaccination efforts, building confidence and trust in these new vaccines will be the difference maker that ends the pandemic and allows a return to normal life.

YouTube is committed to leveraging our platform’s reach (2B+ monthly logged-in viewers) and the diversity of the YouTube creator community, to help make the science of COVID-19 vaccines easy to understand and more accessible to people all over the world.

This is a pivotal moment in history and in public health, and we are deeply invested in ensuring we meet the moment as the platform where the world comes to watch and learn.

We will do this in three ways: First, we’ll continue to raise up authoritative information from Local Health Authorities and community-based health organizations.

Second, we are investing in a new, multimillion-dollar campaign to address vaccine hesitancy in countries around the world.

"There’s no arguing that time spent online is an ever-increasing part of our lives, from how we communicate with friends and family to where we learn and find entertainment.

And because a lot of that happens right here on YouTube, it’s our commitment to invest in the products, built-in protections and easy-to-use tools to make being online safer for people of all ages.

In honor of Safer Internet Day, here are the latest tips that empower you to manage your YouTube experience — from mindfulness customizations and data privacy protections to controls and resources for families.

* 1) Be more mindful of the way you spend time online with digital wellbeing tools We’re all trying to be more thoughtful of how we spend our time online, and over the last few years, we’ve introduced a suite of tools to help you manage your time on YouTube, like bedtime reminders , time watched and controls to tailor autoplay settings .

Safer Internet Day is a great reminder to check your settings and make sure they’re still working for you.

We’re getting families involved, too – we’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S.

These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online.

2) Review and manage your data on a regular basis Looking at your YouTube data regularly helps protect your privacy and gives you more control over your viewing experience.

YouTube makes it easy for you to access your data through the “ Your Data in YouTube '' page.

There you’ll find a summary of your content and activity data, along with settings and controls to manage your data, and information on how it’s used to improve your YouTube experience.

You can browse or delete your YouTube activity - including comments you’ve made on videos and channels you’ve subscribed to – and review your watch and search history, which helps improve your recommendations in YouTube and other Google services.

3) Extend protections for kids and tweens by signing into YouTube Kids and YouTube on eligible devices Every family’s relationship with media and technology is different.

For parents and caregivers, we offer options to help them decide what’s best for their kids and are investing in new ways to improve these experiences.

Signing in to YouTube Kids and YouTube on eligible devices is a quick tip to help YouTube work better for families.

Here’s why: YouTube Kids gives signed-in parents all the controls to customize the experience to the specific needs of their youngest kids.

They can make a profile for each child with individual settings, block content or approve specific channels and videos, and even decide to share content from YouTube directly with their child in YouTube Kids.

Our supervised experience on YouTube works well for families with tweens who have their own mobile device, or want their own account.

We spent the last year expanding support for these supervised accounts so that tweens can sign in to YouTube on gaming consoles, smart TVs, the YouTube Music app and more.

This helps us respect a parent's choice of content setting across devices in the home where their tween watches videos or listens to music.

4) Get tips & connect with kids about online safety with our special YouTube Kids playlist Today’s kids will be lifelong users of technology, and ongoing education is important for their safety and long-term success.

That’s why today, we launched our YouTube Kids playlist, 'Build a Safer Internet,' which you may see upon opening the app.

The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible and positive use of technology for families.

With kid-friendly tips, songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world.

If you have any questions or feedback, let us know! We’re available 24/7 on @TeamYouTube, or you can always check out our YouTube Help Center to learn about the latest announcements.

"OurBug Bounty programworks with researchers to help us detect and fix issues across our apps faster so that we can better protect our community. So far this year, we’ve awarded over $2.3 million to researchers from more than 46 countries and have received around 25,000 reports in total, issuing bounties on over 800. And now we’re expanding our programs to address new challenges and welcome more researchers.
Today, we’re launching two new updates to our Bug Bounty and Data Bounty programs around scraping. As scraping continues to be an internet-wide challenge, we’re excited to open up these new areas of research for our bug bounty community.
We know that automated activity designed to scrape people’s public and private data targets every website or service. We also know that it is a highly adversarial space where scrapers — be it malicious apps, websites or scripts — constantly adapt their tactics to evade detection in response to the defenses we build and improve. As part of our larger security strategy to make scraping harder and more costly for the attackers, today we are beginning to reward valid reports of scraping bugs in our platform.
Starting as a private bounty track for our Gold+HackerPlusresearchers, our bug bounty program will award reports about scraping methods, even if the data they target is public. Specifically, we’re looking to findbugs that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than the product intended. Our goal is to quickly identify and counter scenarios that might make scraping less costly for malicious actors to execute. While lack of proper rate limiting is now included in the program’s scope (our terms still donotallow anyone to automate access and collection of data), we want to particularly encourage research into logic bypass issues that can allow access to information via unintended mechanisms, even if proper rate limits exist. We’ve provided our Gold+ researchers with examples on such bypasses to help jumpstart this research.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scraping bug bounty program in the industry. We will work to address feedback from our top bounty hunters before expanding the scope to a greater audience.
Starting today, our data bounty program will also cover scraped datasets found online. We will reward reports of unprotected or openly public databases containing at least 100,000 unique Facebook user records with PII or sensitive data (e.g. email, phone number, physical address, religious or political affiliation). The reported dataset must be unique and not previously known or reported to Meta. We aim to learn from this effort so we can expand the scope to smaller datasets over time.
If we confirm that user PII was scraped and is now available online on a non-Meta site, we will work to take appropriate measures, which may include working with the relevant entity to remove the dataset or seeking legal means to help ensure the issue is addressed.For example, if the dataset is a result of a misconfigured third-party application, we will work with the developer to address the issue. Alternatively, if the dataset is exposed on a hosting service (e.g. S3 bucket, file-sharing service), we will make efforts with the host (Amazon, Box, Dropbox, etc.) to take this dataset offline.
As always, we will issue rewards in both programs based on the maximum impact of each report, with a minimum reward of $500 per each scraping bug or dataset.
Scrapeddatasets:We will reward valid reports of scraped datasets in the form of charity donations to nonprofits of our researchers’ choosing to ensure that we do not incentivize scraping activity. Per our donation matching policy, we will match each bounty, which means that researchers will be directing an even higher bounty to the causes important to them.
Scraping bugs:We will be issuing monetary rewards for valid reports about scraping bugs, similar to how we’ve always issued rewards for eligible submissions to our Bug Bounty program. Researchers, of course, can choose to donate a bounty to a recognized charity (subject to approval by Meta).
We’re looking forward to our community’s research and feedback in these two new research areas.

So far this year, we’ve awarded over $2.3 million to researchers from more than 46 countries and have received around 25,000 reports in total, issuing bounties on over 800. And now we’re expanding our programs to address new challenges and welcome more researchers.
Today, we’re launching two new updates to our Bug Bounty and Data Bounty programs around scraping. As scraping continues to be an internet-wide challenge, we’re excited to open up these new areas of research for our bug bounty community.
We know that automated activity designed to scrape people’s public and private data targets every website or service. We also know that it is a highly adversarial space where scrapers — be it malicious apps, websites or scripts — constantly adapt their tactics to evade detection in response to the defenses we build and improve. As part of our larger security strategy to make scraping harder and more costly for the attackers, today we are beginning to reward valid reports of scraping bugs in our platform.
Starting as a private bounty track for our Gold+HackerPlusresearchers, our bug bounty program will award reports about scraping methods, even if the data they target is public. Specifically, we’re looking to findbugs that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than the product intended. Our goal is to quickly identify and counter scenarios that might make scraping less costly for malicious actors to execute. While lack of proper rate limiting is now included in the program’s scope (our terms still donotallow anyone to automate access and collection of data), we want to particularly encourage research into logic bypass issues that can allow access to information via unintended mechanisms, even if proper rate limits exist. We’ve provided our Gold+ researchers with examples on such bypasses to help jumpstart this research.

"Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global public health emergency, we’ve been working to connect people to accurate information and taking aggressive steps to stop misinformation and harmful content from spreading. Today we’re sharing an update on these efforts across our apps.

On Facebook and Instagram:In January, we started showing educational pop-ups connecting people to information from the WHO, the CDC and regional health authorities toward the top of News Feed in countries with reported person-to-person transmissions and in all countries when people search for COVID-19 related information. We show similar pop-ups at the top of Instagram Feed in the hardest hit countries and when anyone taps on a COVID-19 relatedhashtag.
Last week, we launched the COVID-19 Information Center, which is now featured at the top of News Feed on Facebook in several countries and includes real-time updates from national health authorities and global organizations, such as the WHO. The COVID-19 Information Center will be available globally soon.
Through these efforts across Facebook and Instagram, we’ve directed more than 1 billion people to resources from health authorities including the WHO – more than 100 million of whom clicked through to learn more.
We’re also giving the WHO as many free ads as they need and millions in ad credits to other health authorities so they can reach people with timely messages.
On WhatsApp: People can sign up to receive theWHO Health Alerton WhatsApp,a daily report with the latest numbers of COVID-19 cases. It also includes tips on how to prevent the spread of the disease as well as answers to commonly asked questions that people can easily send to their friends and family. We’re also working directly with health ministries in the UK, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Israel, South Africa and other countries to provide similar health updates specific to those nations. In the last week, over 100 million messages have been sent by these organizations to WhatsApp users. In addition, we donated $1 million to the International Fact-Checking Network to expand the presence offact-checking organizations on WhatsApp, so people can submit rumors they find directly to fact-checkers. More information is available atwhatsapp.com/coronavirus.
On Messenger: We’re connecting government health organizations and UN health agencies with ourdeveloper partnerswho can help them use Messenger most effectively to share timely information with people and speed up their replies to commonly asked questions. Agencies such asUNICEF,Argentina’s Ministry of HealthandPakistan’s Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordinationare already using Messenger to ensure people have the latest information about COVID-19.
On Facebook and Instagram:We remove COVID-19 related misinformation thatcould contribute to imminent physical harm.We’ve removed harmful misinformation since 2018, including false information about the measles in Samoa where it could have furthered an outbreak and rumors about the polio vaccine in Pakistan where it risked harm to health aid workers. Since January, we’ve applied this policy to misinformation about COVID-19 to remove posts that make false claims about cures, treatments, the availability of essential servicesor the location and severity of the outbreak. We regularly update the claims that we remove based on guidance from the WHO and other health authorities. For example, we recently started removing claims that physical distancing doesn’t help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. We’ve also banned ads and commerce listings that imply a product guarantees a cure or prevents people from contracting COVID-19.
For claims that don’t directly result in physical harm, like conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, we continue to work with our network of over 55 fact-checking partners covering over 45 languages to debunk these claims. To support the global fact-checking community’s work on COVID-19, wepartnered with the Independent Fact-Checking Network to launch a$1 million grant programto increase their capacity during this time.
Once a post is rated false by a fact-checker, we reduce its distribution so fewer people see it, and we show strong warning labels and notifications to people who still come across it, try to share it or already have. This helps give more context when these hoaxes appear elsewhere online, over SMS or offline in conversations with friends and family.On Instagram, we remove COVID-19 accounts from recommendations and we’re working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore, unless posted by a credible health organization.
On WhatsApp and Messenger:We’ve built clear labels that show people when they have received a forwarded message, or chain message, so they know when they are receiving something that was not written by their immediate contacts. We’ve also set a limit on the number of times messages can be forwarded on WhatsApp to reduce the spread of viral messages, and we use advanced machine learning to identify and ban accounts engaged in mass messaging. Similarly, we’ll soon begin testing stricter limits on Messenger to control the number of chats someone can forward a message to at one time.

"When you take an action on Facebook, such as following a Page or liking a post, we use that information to personalize your experience, including the ads you see. Businesses can also choose to send us information about actions you take on their websites and apps, and we use that information to show you more relevant content. We call this personalization, and it’s how we try to show you content you care about, instead of things that don’t interest you.
Personalized advertising helps you discover new products and brands, and it enables businesses of all sizes, not just the ones with the biggest budgets, to reach people who are likely to be interested in what they offer. This helps enable small businesses to use their modest ad budgets most effectively to connect with customers and grow. Without personalized advertising, many new products and services would never get off the ground or would cost more, and you’d see ads that are less relevant, less timely and, therefore, interest you less.
We know there is growing interest in — and sometimes concern about — how online advertising affects your privacy. For example, Apple is now requiring all developers to submit new information about their data practices, including around advertising. We believe it is important to educate people about our data practices, but we are concerned that the format of Apple’s new labels ignores how data is used in context and could create confusion. These new requirements appear to reflect Apple’s belief that personalization and privacy are at odds. We disagree:personalization doesn’t have to come at the expense of privacy. We can do both, and we can do both well. We’ve built products that lead the industry in transparency and offer settings and controls to help people manage their privacy.Our products and data policies remain the best resources to understand our data practices.
Our approach is to be clear about how our apps work and give you control over your experience, so we’ve worked with policymakers, regulators, academics, civil society, businesses and other stakeholders over the years to build tools that show you how your information is used and let you manage it.
For example, you can tapWhy Am I Seeing This?on any ad in News Feed to get more information and control what you see going forward. This will show you reasons why you’re seeing a certain ad, whether it’s based on interests that matched you with the ad or actions you took on the business’ website, and where possible, you’ll be able to see how that information was gathered. From there, you also have easy access to controls, likeAd Preferences, which lets you manage the ads you see, learn more about how ads work and hide ads from specific advertisers or topics.
We also offerOff-Facebook Activity, which lets you see a summary of the apps and websites that send Facebook information about your activity, and clear this information from your account if you want to.So if you recently bought a hiking backpack from a local outdoor gear supplier and are no longer looking for a new one, you can choose to remove the outdoor gear supplier from this list of businesses, and disconnect that information from your account. To build this tool, we conducted months of research with people and businesses to understand how to present this information in the most helpful way for people. We also added a new feature based on our research to give people greater control over the activity that apps and websites share with Facebook going forward.
And our controls aren’t just for ads. We also offer tools likeManage Activity,Privacy Checkupand ways toview and download your information, so you can easily customize your overall experience on Facebook based on what’s right for you.
We’ll continue to work with industry partners andinvest in buildingnew privacy technologybecause we believe that with the right controls, we can preserve the value that both people and businesses get out of personalized advertising, while respecting privacy and empowering people to control their information online.",,,,Personalized Advertising and Privacy Are Not at Odds,"December 16, 2020",,"December 16, 2020",,en-en,"Advertising, Privacy Matters, Small Businesses, Data and Privacy, Public Policy",en,English,,,"When you take an action on Facebook, such as following a Page or liking a post, we use that information to personalize your experience, including the ads you see. Businesses can also choose to send us information about actions you take on their websites and apps, and we use that information to show you more relevant content. We call this personalization, and it’s how we try to show you content you care about, instead of things that don’t interest you.
Personalized advertising helps you discover new products and brands, and it enables businesses of all sizes, not just the ones with the biggest budgets, to reach people who are likely to be interested in what they offer. This helps enable small businesses to use their modest ad budgets most effectively to connect with customers and grow. Without personalized advertising, many new products and services would never get off the ground or would cost more, and you’d see ads that are less relevant, less timely and, therefore, interest you less.
We know there is growing interest in — and sometimes concern about — how online advertising affects your privacy. For example, Apple is now requiring all developers to submit new information about their data practices, including around advertising. We believe it is important to educate people about our data practices, but we are concerned that the format of Apple’s new labels ignores how data is used in context and could create confusion. These new requirements appear to reflect Apple’s belief that personalization and privacy are at odds. We disagree:personalization doesn’t have to come at the expense of privacy. We can do both, and we can do both well. We’ve built products that lead the industry in transparency and offer settings and controls to help people manage their privacy.Our products and data policies remain the best resources to understand our data practices.
Our approach is to be clear about how our apps work and give you control over your experience, so we’ve worked with policymakers, regulators, academics, civil society, businesses and other stakeholders over the years to build tools that show you how your information is used and let you manage it.

People want and benefit from personalized experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience. We want to support both.
Today we’re starting to test Facebook News, a dedicated place for news on Facebook, to a subset of people in the US. News gives people more control over the stories they see, and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests, directly within the Facebook app. It also highlights the most relevant national stories of the day. News articles will continue to appear in News Feed as they do today.
As we looked to build a place where people can find more news on Facebook, we changed our approach to gather insight from journalists and publishersbeforewe started developing a product.AsMark Zuckerberg said in a conversation with Mathias Döpfner,CEO of Europe’s largest publisher Axel Springer, we wanted to build this product in a consultative way, sharing our ideas and getting input from the industry.We talked to news organizations about what they’d like to see included in a news tab, how their stories should be presented and what analytics to provide.
As we talked to people and publishers, we identified key features to help make Facebook News valuable:
Regarding personalization, publishers worry that machine learning has limits and they’re right. We have progress to make before we can rely on technology alone to provide a quality news destination. We also aim to serve both people and news publishers, and not just the big national players. We want new forms of journalism in the digital age, including individual, independent journalism, to flourish. So we will continue to expand the algorithmic selection of stories driving the majority of Facebook News.
When we started talking to news organizations about building Facebook News earlier this year, they emphasized that original reporting is more expensive to produce and better recognized by seasoned journalists than by algorithms. So to help reward this kind of work, we formed a curation team to manage the Today’s Stories section of Facebook News. The team will have editorial independence and will select stories based on publicly available guidelines, which you can learn about at facebook.com/news.
What You Can Expect to See in Facebook News
Facebook News will feature a widerange of contentacross four categories of publishers: general, topical, diverse and local news. At the beginning of the year, we surveyed over 100,000 people on Facebook in the US about what topics they were most interested in and found that we were under-serving many topics people wanted most in their News Feeds, especially around categories like entertainment, health, business and sports. We took this into consideration as we identified publishers across those four categories.
How do we identify these publishers? They need to be in ourNews Page Index, which we developed in collaboration with the industry to identify news content. They also need to abide byFacebook’s Publisher Guidelines, these include a range of integrity signals in determining product eligibility, including misinformation — as identified based onthird-party fact checkers— community standards violations (e.g., hate speech), clickbait, engagement bait and others. We’ll continually check Pages’ integrity status to ensure eligibility criteria is consistently being met.Lastly, they must serve a sufficiently large audience, with different thresholds for the four categories of publishers.
Our criteria will evolve over time to make sure people are seeing sources that are valuable to them and that we’re including reporting across these topics.
During the initial test, we’ll showcase local original reporting by surfacing local publications from the largest major metro areas across the country, beginning with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington DC, Miami, Atlanta and Boston. In the coming months, we’ll include local news from Today In, our local news and community information tab, whichrecently expanded to over 6,000 US towns and cities.

"Over the past year, we’ve shared a number of updates on the work of our External Data Misuse (EDM) and legal teams tocombat unauthorized data scrapingacross our services. Today, we’re sharing an update on clone sites — what they are and the risks they carry, how our teams are working to address them and ways you can protect your data.We also announced litigationtargeting clone sites and scraping for-hire services.
A clone site is a third-party site that duplicates, in whole or in part, the content of an existing site. Among other things, clone sites can be used to display people’s scraped data, scam people, and damage the credibility of the original site.
One of the ways clone sites are able to compile people’s data is through the use of self-compromised accounts. A common way this happens is when people provide their Facebook or Instagram credentials to websites and apps offeringfree likes, followers or other promises in exchange for their Facebook or Instagram credentials. None of the services are authorized, affiliated with or endorsed by Meta.
People should never provide their Facebook or Instagram passwordanywhereonline outside of logging in through the official Facebook or Instagram website and apps or through the “Login with Facebook” button that we allow authorized third-party developers to provide on their site.
In the first half of 2021, we tracked over 100 different Instagram clone sites. By mid-year, through our disruption efforts, the known clone site ecosystem was reduced by approximately 90%.
In 2020,we filed an actionagainst a defendant scraping people’s publicly-visible information from Instagram in order to create a network of clone sites. This was a violation of our Terms of Service and we filed a lawsuit in order to protect our users. The Court recently issued a final judgment in our favor and found Defendant liable for scraping data from Instagram users and republishing it on his clones sites. The Defendant was ordered by the Court to pay over $200,000 and is banned from using Facebook or Instagram. This decision will help protect people and send a message that this conduct is not tolerated by Meta.
We continue to take action against unauthorized scraping and clone sites. Today,we filed a lawsuitin Northern California to enforce our Terms of Use. Operating under the name “MyStalk,” the defendant Ekrem Ateş used unauthorized automation software to improperly access and collect — or “scrape” — the profiles of Instagram users.
MyStalk’s software used thousands of automated Instagram accounts that falsely identified themselves as legitimate Instagram users connected to either the official Instagram mobile application or website. Through this fraudulent connection, the Defendant scraped data from the profiles of over 350,000 Instagram users and collected posts, photos, Stories, and profile information. These profiles had not been set to private by the users and, beyond a limited number of profiles and posts, were publicly viewable only to logged-in Instagram users. Defendant published the scraped data on his own websites, which display user data scraped from Instagram.
Since February 2021, we have taken a number of enforcement actions against this Defendant, including disabling accounts, sending a cease and desist letter, and revoking the Defendant’s access to Meta’s services.
Giving unauthorized apps or websites your login credentials provides them with complete access to your account, allowing them to see personal messages, find information on your friends and potentially post harmful content on your profile.
When people compromise their accounts in this way, they lose visibility and control of who is viewing their content and interacting with their account, and their data can be used for a variety of potentially nefarious purposes.

"Today we’re announcing a ban on praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism on Facebook and Instagram, which we’ll start enforcing next week. It’s clear that these concepts are deeply linked to organized hate groupsand have no place on our services.
Our policies have long prohibited hateful treatment of people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity or religion — and that has always included white supremacy. We didn’t originally apply the same rationale to expressions of white nationalism and white separatism because we were thinking about broader concepts of nationalism and separatism — things like American pride and Basque separatism, which are an important part of people’s identity.
But over the past three months our conversations with members of civil society and academics who are experts in race relations around the world have confirmed that white nationalism and white separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups. Our own review of hate figures and organizations – as defined by ourDangerous Individuals & Organizations policy– further revealed the overlap between white nationalism and white separatism and white supremacy. Going forward, while people will still be able to demonstrate pride in their ethnic heritage, we will not tolerate praise or support for white nationalism and white separatism.
We also need to get better and faster at finding and removing hate from our platforms. Over the past few years we have improved our ability to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to find material from terrorist groups. Last fall, we started using similar tools to extend our efforts to a range of hate groups globally, including white supremacists. We’re making progress, but we know we have a lot more work to do.
Our efforts to combat hate don’t stop here. As part of today’s announcement, we’ll also start connecting people who search for terms associated with white supremacy to resources focused on helping people leave behind hate groups. People searching for these terms will be directed toLife After Hate, an organization founded by former violent extremists that provides crisis intervention, education, support groups and outreach.
Unfortunately, there will always be people who try to game our systems to spread hate. Our challenge is to stay ahead by continuing to improve our technologies, evolve our policies and work with experts who can bolster our own efforts. We are deeply committed and will share updates as this process moves forward.

We know that people want to see accurate information on Facebook, so for the last two years, we’ve made fighting misinformation a priority. One of themany stepswe take to reduce the spread of false news is working with independent, third-partyfact-checkersto review andrate the accuracyof content. To date, most of our fact-checking partners have focused on reviewing articles. However, we have also been actively working to build new technology and partnerships so that we can tackle other forms of misinformation. Today, we’reexpanding fact-checking for photos and videos to all of our27 partnersin 17 countries around the world(and are regularly on-boarding new fact-checking partners). This will help us identify and take action against more types of misinformation, faster.
How does this work?Similar to our work for articles, we have built a machine learning model that uses various engagement signals, including feedback from people on Facebook, to identify potentially false content. We then send those photos and videos to fact-checkers for their review, or fact-checkers can surface content on their own. Many of our third-party fact-checking partners have expertise evaluating photos and videos and are trained in visual verification techniques, such as reverse image searching and analyzing image metadata, like when and where the photo or video was taken. Fact-checkers are able to assess the truth or falsity of a photo or video by combining these skills with other journalistic practices, like using research from experts, academics or government agencies.
As we get more ratings from fact-checkers on photos and videos, we will be able to improve the accuracy of our machine learning model. We are also leveraging other technologies to better recognize false or misleading content. For example, we useoptical character recognition(OCR) to extract text from photos and compare that text to headlines from fact-checkers’ articles. We are also working on new ways to detect if a photo or video has been manipulated. These technologies will help us identify more potentially deceptive photos and videos to send to fact-checkers for manual review. Learn more about how we approach this work inan interviewwith Tessa Lyons, Product Manager on News Feed.
How do we categorize false photos and videos?Based on several months of research and testing with a handful of partners sinceMarch, we know that misinformation in photos and videos usually falls into three categories: (1) Manipulated or Fabricated, (2) Out of Context, and (3) Text or Audio Claim. These are the kinds of false photos and videos that we see on Facebook and hope to further reduce with the expansion of photo and video fact-checking.

(See more details on these examples from the fact-checkers’ debunking articles:Animal Politico,AFP,France 24, andBoom Live).
What’s different about photos and videos?People share millions of photos and videos on Facebook every day. We know that this kind of sharing is particularly compelling because it’s visual. That said, it also creates an easy opportunity for manipulation by bad actors. Based on research with people around the world, we know that false news spreads in many different forms, varying from country to country. For example, in the US, people say they see more misinformation in articles, whereas in Indonesia, people say they see more misleading photos. However, these categories are not distinct. The same hoax can travel across different content types, so it’s important to build defenses against misinformation across articles, as well as photos and videos.

What’s next?We know that fighting false news is a long-term commitment as the tactics used by bad actors are always changing. As we take action in the short-term, we’re also continuing to invest in more technology and partnerships so that we can stay ahead of new types of misinformation in the future.

"Today, Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Georgetown University about the importance of protecting free expression. He underscored his belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time — a belief that’s at the core of Facebook.
In front of hundreds of students at the school’s Gaston Hall, Mark warned that we’re increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression and human rights. He argued that in order to make sure people can continue to have a voice, we should: 1) write policy that helps the values of voice and expression triumph around the world, 2)fend off the urge to define speech we don’t like as dangerous, and 3) build new institutions so companies like Facebook aren’t making so many important decisions about speech on our own.
Read Mark’s full speech below.
Hey everyone. It’s great to be here at Georgetown with all of you today.
Before we get started, I want to acknowledge that today we lost an icon, Elijah Cummings. He was a powerful voice for equality, social progress and bringing people together.
When I was in college, our country had just gone to war in Iraq. The mood on campus was disbelief. It felt like we were acting without hearing a lot of important perspectives. The toll on soldiers, families and our national psyche was severe, and most of us felt powerless to stop it. I remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently. Those early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.
Back then, I was building an early version of Facebook for my community, and I got to see my beliefs play out at smaller scale. When students got to express who they were and what mattered to them, they organized more social events, started more businesses, and even challenged some established ways of doing things on campus. It taught me that while the world’s attention focuses on major events and institutions, the bigger story is that most progress in our lives comes from regular people having more of a voice.
Since then, I’ve focused on building services to do two things: give people voice, and bring people together. These two simple ideas — voice and inclusion — go hand in hand. We’ve seen this throughout history, even if it doesn’t feel that way today. More people being able to share their perspectives has always been necessary to build a more inclusive society. And our mutual commitment to each other — that we hold each others’ right to express our views and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want — is how we make progress together.
But this view is increasingly being challenged. Some people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that’s dangerous. Today I want to talk about why, and some important choices we face around free expression.
Throughout history, we’ve seen how being able to use your voice helps people come together. We’ve seen this in the civil rights movement. Frederick Douglass once called free expression “the great moral renovator of society”. He said “slavery cannot tolerate free speech”. Civil rights leaders argued time and again that their protests were protected free expression, and one noted: “nearly all the cases involving the civil rights movement were decided on First Amendment grounds”.
We’ve seen this globally too, where the ability to speak freely has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide. The most repressive societies have always restricted speech the most — and when people are finally able to speak, they often call for change. This year alone, people have used their voices to end multiple long-running dictatorships in Northern Africa. And we’re already hearing from voices in those countries that had been excluded just because they were women, or they believed in democracy.
Our idea of free expression has become much broader over even the last 100 years. Many Americans know about the Enlightenment history and how we enshrined the First Amendment in our constitution, but fewer know how dramatically our cultural norms and legal protections have expanded, even in recent history.
The first Supreme Court case to seriously consider free speech and the First Amendment was in 1919, Schenk vs the United States. Back then, the First Amendment only applied to the federal government, and states could and often did restrict your right to speak. Our ability to call out things we felt were wrong also used to be much more restricted. Libel laws used to impose damages if you wrote something negative about someone, even if it was true. The standard later shifted so it became okay as long as you could prove your critique was true. We didn’t get the broad free speech protections we have now until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times vs Sullivan that you can criticize public figures as long as you’re not doing so with actual malice, even if what you’re saying is false.
We now have significantly broader power to call out things we feel are unjust and share our own personal experiences. Movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo went viral on Facebook — the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was actually first used on Facebook — and this just wouldn’t have been possible in the same way before. 100 years back, many of the stories people have shared would have been against the law to even write down. And without the internet giving people the power to share them directly, they certainly wouldn’t have reached as many people. With Facebook, more than 2 billion people now have a greater opportunity to express themselves and help others.
While it’s easy to focus on major social movements, it’s important to remember that most progress happens in our everyday lives. It’s the Air Force moms who started a Facebook group so their children and other service members who can’t get home for the holidays have a place to go. It’s the church group that came together during a hurricane to provide food and volunteer to help with recovery. It’s the small business on the corner that now has access to the same sophisticated tools only the big guys used to, and now they can get their voice out and reach more customers, create jobs and become a hub in their local community. Progress and social cohesion come from billions of stories like this around the world.
People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world — a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society. People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences. I understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralized power, but I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people’s hands. It’s part of this amazing expansion of voice through law, culture and technology.
So giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand, and the trend has been towards greater voice over time. But there’s also a counter-trend. In times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression. We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension.
We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully. We saw this in the efforts to shut down campus protests against the Vietnam War. We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I, and the Supreme Court ruled that socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech.
In the end, all of these decisions were wrong. Pulling back on free expression wasn’t the answer and, in fact, it often ended up hurting the minority views we seek to protect. From where we are now, it seems obvious that, of course, protests for civil rights or against wars should be allowed. Yet the desire to suppress this expression was felt deeply by much of society at the time.
Today, we are in another time of social tension. We face real issues that will take a long time to work through — massive economic transitions from globalization and technology, fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, and polarized reactions to greater migration. Many of our issues flow from these changes.
In the face of these tensions, once again a popular impulse is to pull back from free expression. We’re at another cross-roads. We can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. Or we can decide the cost is simply too great. I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.
At the same time, I know that free expression has never been absolute. Some people argue internet platforms should allow all expression protected by the First Amendment, even though the First Amendment explicitly doesn’t apply to companies. I’m proud that our values at Facebook are inspired by the American tradition, which is more supportive of free expression than anywhere else. But even American tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on others’ rights. And still, a strict First Amendment standard might require us to allow terrorist propaganda, bullying young people and more that almost everyone agrees we should stop — and I certainly do — as well as content like pornography that would make people uncomfortable using our platforms.
So once we’re taking this content down, the question is: where do you draw the line? Most people agree with the principles that you should be able to say things other people don’t like, but you shouldn’t be able to say things that put people in danger. The shift over the past several years is that many people would now argue that more speech is dangerous than would have before. This raises the question of exactly what counts as dangerous speech online. It’s worth examining this in detail.
Many arguments about online speech are related to new properties of the internet itself. If you believe the internet is completely different from everything before it, then it doesn’t make sense to focus on historical precedent. But we should be careful of overly broad arguments since they’ve been made about almost every new technology, from the printing press to radio to TV. Instead, let’s consider the specific ways the internet is different and how internet services like ours might address those risks while protecting free expression.
One clear difference is that a lot more people now have a voice — almost half the world. That’s dramatically empowering for all the reasons I’ve mentioned. But inevitably some people will use their voice to organize violence, undermine elections or hurt others, and we have a responsibility to address these risks. When you’re serving billions of people, even if a very small percent cause harm, that can still be a lot of harm.
We build specific systems to address each type of harmful content — from incitement of violence to child exploitation to other harms like intellectual property violations — about 20 categories in total. We judge ourselves by the prevalence of harmful content and what percent we find proactively before anyone reports it to us. For example, our AI systems identify 99% of the terrorist content we take down before anyone even sees it. This is a massive investment. We now have over 35,000 people working on security, and our security budget today is greater than the entire revenue of our company at the time of our IPO earlier this decade.
All of this work is about enforcing our existing policies, not broadening our definition of what is dangerous. If we do this well, we should be able to stop a lot of harm while fighting back against putting additional restrictions on speech.
Another important difference is how quickly ideas can spread online. Most people can now get much more reach than they ever could before. This is at the heart of a lot of the positive uses of the internet. It’s empowering that anyone can start a fundraiser, share an idea, build a business, or create a movement that can grow quickly. But we’ve seen this go the other way too — most notably when Russia’s IRA tried to interfere in the 2016 elections, but also when misinformation has gone viral. Some people argue that virality itself is dangerous, and we need tighter filters on what content can spread quickly.
For misinformation, we focus on making sure complete hoaxes don’t go viral. We especially focus on misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, like misleading health advice saying if you’re having a stroke, no need to go to the hospital.
More broadly though, we’ve found a different strategy works best: focusing on the authenticity of the speaker rather than the content itself. Much of the content the Russian accounts shared was distasteful but would have been considered permissible political discourse if it were shared by Americans — the real issue was that it was posted by fake accounts coordinating together and pretending to be someone else. We’ve seen a similar issue with these groups that pump out misinformation like spam just to make money.
The solution is to verify the identities of accounts getting wide distribution and get better at removing fake accounts. We now require you to provide a government ID and prove your location if you want to run political ads or a large page. You can still say controversial things, but you have to stand behind them with your real identity and face accountability. Our AI systems have also gotten more advanced at detecting clusters of fake accounts that aren’t behaving like humans. We now remove billions of fake accounts a year — most within minutes of registering and before they do much. Focusing on authenticity and verifying accounts is a much better solution than an ever-expanding definition of what speech is harmful.
Another qualitative difference is the internet lets people form communities that wouldn’t have been possible before. This is good because it helps people find groups where they belong and share interests. But the flip side is this has the potential to lead to polarization. I care a lot about this — after all, our goal is to bring people together.
Much of the research I’ve seen is mixed and suggests the internet could actually decrease aspects of polarization. The most polarized voters in the last presidential election were the people least likely to use the internet. Research from the Reuters Institute also shows people who get their news online actually have a much more diverse media diet than people who don’t, and they’re exposed to a broader range of viewpoints. This is because most people watch only a couple of cable news stations or read only a couple of newspapers, but even if most of your friends online have similar views, you usually have some that are different, and you get exposed to different perspectives through them. Still, we have an important role in designing our systems to show a diversity of ideas and not encourage polarizing content.
One last difference with the internet is it lets people share things that would have been impossible before. Take live-streaming, for example. This allows families to be together for moments like birthdays and even weddings, schoolteachers to read bedtime stories to kids who might not be read to, and people to witness some very important events. But we’ve also seen people broadcast self-harm, suicide, and terrible violence. These are new challenges and our responsibility is to build systems that can respond quickly.
We’re particularly focused on well-being, especially for young people. We built a team of thousands of people and AI systems that can detect risks of self-harm within minutes so we can reach out when people need help most. In the last year, we’ve helped first responders reach people who needed help thousands of times.
For each of these issues, I believe we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it could cause real danger as effectively as we can, and to fight to uphold as wide a definition of freedom of expression as possible — and not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary. That’s what I’m committed to.
But beyond these new properties of the internet, there are also shifting cultural sensitivities and diverging views on what people consider dangerous content.
Take misinformation. No one tells us they want to see misinformation. That’s why we work with independent fact checkers to stop hoaxes that are going viral from spreading. But misinformation is a pretty broad category. A lot of people like satire, which isn’t necessarily true. A lot of people talk about their experiences through stories that may be exaggerated or have inaccuracies, but speak to a deeper truth in their lived experience. We need to be careful about restricting that. Even when there is a common set of facts, different media outlets tell very different stories emphasizing different angles. There’s a lot of nuance here. And while I worry about an erosion of truth, I don’t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true.
We recently clarified our policies to ensure people can see primary source speech from political figures that shapes civic discourse. Political advertising is more transparent on Facebook than anywhere else — we keep all political and issue ads in an archive so everyone can scrutinize them, and no TV or print does that. We don’t fact-check political ads. We don’t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. And if content is newsworthy, we also won’t take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards.

I know many people disagree, but, in general, I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we’re not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads.

American tradition also has some precedent here. The Supreme Court case I mentioned earlier that gave us our current broad speech rights, New York Times vs Sullivan, was actually about an ad with misinformation, supporting Martin Luther King Jr. and criticizing an Alabama police department. The police commissioner sued the Times for running the ad, the jury in Alabama found against the Times, and the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the decision, creating today’s speech standard.
As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies. Of course there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don’t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm — and of course we don’t allow voter suppression. Voting is voice. Fighting voter suppression may be as important for the civil rights movement as free expression has been. Just as we’re inspired by the First Amendment, we’re inspired by the 15th Amendment too.

Given the sensitivity around political ads, I’ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether. From a business perspective, the controversy certainly isn’t worth the small part of our business they make up. But political ads are an important part of voice — especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.
Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it’s not clear where we’d draw the line. There are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women’s empowerment? If we banned candidates’ ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves? There are issues any way you cut this, and when it’s not absolutely clear what to do, I believe we should err on the side of greater expression.
Or take hate speech, which we define as someone directly attacking a person or group based on a characteristic like race, gender or religion. We take down content that could lead to real world violence. In countries at risk of conflict, that includes anything that could lead to imminent violence or genocide. And we know from history that dehumanizing people is the first step towards inciting violence. If you say immigrants are vermin, or all Muslims are terrorists — that makes others feel they can escalate and attack that group without consequences. So we don’t allow that. I take this incredibly seriously, and we work hard to get this off our platform.
American free speech tradition recognizes that some speech can have the effect of restricting others’ right to speak. While American law doesn’t recognize “hate speech” as a category, it does prohibit racial harassment and sexual harassment. We still have a strong culture of free expression even while our laws prohibit discrimination.
But still, people have broad disagreements over what qualifies as hate and shouldn’t be allowed. Some people think our policies don’t prohibit content they think qualifies as hate, while others think what we take down should be a protected form of expression. This area is one of the hardest to get right.
I believe people should be able to use our services to discuss issues they feel strongly about — from religion and immigration to foreign policy and crime. You should even be able to be critical of groups without dehumanizing them. But even this isn’t always straightforward to judge at scale, and it often leads to enforcement mistakes. Is someone re-posting a video of a racist attack because they’re condemning it, or glorifying and encouraging people to copy it? Are they using normal slang, or using an innocent word in a new way to incite violence? Now multiply those linguistic challenges by more than 100 languages around the world.
Rules about what you can and can’t say often have unintended consequences. When speech restrictions were implemented in the UK in the last century, parliament noted they were applied more heavily to citizens from poorer backgrounds because the way they expressed things didn’t match the elite Oxbridge style. In everything we do, we need to make sure we’re empowering people, not simply reinforcing existing institutions and power structures.
That brings us back to the cross-roads we all find ourselves at today. Will we continue fighting to give more people a voice to be heard, or will we pull back from free expression?
I see three major threats ahead:
The first is legal. We’re increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression and people’s human rights. These local laws are each individually troubling, especially when they shut down speech in places where there isn’t democracy or freedom of the press. But it’s even worse when countries try to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world.
This raises a larger question about the future of the global internet. China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries. Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There’s no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese.

We’re beginning to see this in social media. While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the US.
Is that the internet we want?
It’s one of the reasons we don’t operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China. I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society. I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in. And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.
This question of which nation’s values will determine what speech is allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective our debates about the content issues of the day. While we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree. That’s what free expression is. And the fact that we can even have this conversation means that we’re at least debating from some common values. If another nation’s platforms set the rules, our discourse will be defined by a completely different set of values.

To push back against this, as we all work to define internet policy and regulation to address public safety, we should also be proactive and write policy that helps the values of voice and expression triumph around the world.
The second challenge to expression is the platforms themselves — including us. Because the reality is we make a lot of decisions that affect people’s ability to speak.
I’m committed to the values we’re discussing today, but we won’t always get it right. I understand people are concerned that we have so much control over how they communicate on our services. And I understand people are concerned about bias and making sure their ideas are treated fairly. Frankly, I don’t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either. We’d benefit from a more democratic process, clearer rules for the internet, and new institutions.
That’s why we’re establishing an independent Oversight Board for people to appeal our content decisions. The board will have the power to make final binding decisions about whether content stays up or comes down on our services — decisions that our team and I can’t overturn. We’re going to appoint members to this board who have a diversity of views and backgrounds, but who each hold free expression as their paramount value.
Building this institution is important to me personally because I’m not always going to be here, and I want to ensure the values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed.
The third challenge to expression is the hardest because it comes from our culture. We’re at a moment of particular tension here and around the world — and we’re seeing the impulse to restrict speech and enforce new norms around what people can say.
Increasingly, we’re seeing people try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they see as unacceptable. Some hold the view that since the stakes are so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves.
I personally believe this is more dangerous for democracy over the long term than almost any speech. Democracy depends on the idea that we hold each others’ right to express ourselves and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want. You can’t impose tolerance top-down. It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a shared story for society that we all feel we’re a part of. That’s how we make progress together.

So how do we turn the tide? Someone once told me our founding fathers thought free expression was like air. You don’t miss it until it’s gone. When people don’t feel they can express themselves, they lose faith in democracy and they’re more likely to support populist parties that prioritize specific policy goals over the health of our democratic norms.
I’m a little more optimistic. I don’t think we need to lose our freedom of expression to realize how important it is. I think people understand and appreciate the voice they have now. At some fundamental level, I think most people believe in their fellow people too.
As long as our governments respect people’s right to express themselves, as long as our platforms live up to their responsibilities to support expression and prevent harm, and as long as we all commit to being open and making space for more perspectives, I think we’ll make progress. It’ll take time, but we’ll work through this moment. We overcame deep polarization after World War I, and intense political violence in the 1960s. Progress isn’t linear. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. But if we can’t agree to let each other talk about the issues, we can’t take the first step. Even when it’s hard, this is how we build a shared understanding.
So yes, we have big disagreements. Maybe more now than at any time in recent history. But part of that is because we’re getting our issues out on the table — issues that for a long time weren’t talked about. More people from more parts of our society have a voice than ever before, and it will take time to hear these voices and knit them together into a coherent narrative. Sometimes we hope for a singular event to resolve these conflicts, but that’s never been how it works. We focus on the major institutions — from governments to large companies — but the bigger story has always been regular people using their voice to take billions of individual steps forward to make our lives and our communities better.
The future depends on all of us. Whether you like Facebook or not, we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for free expression at this critical moment.
I believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people. And as long as enough of us keep fighting for this, I believe that more people’s voices will eventually help us work through these issues together and write a new chapter in our history — where from all of our individual voices and perspectives, we can bring the world closer together.
",,,,Mark Zuckerberg Stands for Voice and Free Expression,"October 17, 2019",,"November 18, 2019",,en-en,"Speeches, Company News, Integrity and Security, Safety and Expression, Strengthening Communities",en,English,,,"Today, Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Georgetown University about the importance of protecting free expression. He underscored his belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time — a belief that’s at the core of Facebook.
In front of hundreds of students at the school’s Gaston Hall, Mark warned that we’re increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression and human rights. He argued that in order to make sure people can continue to have a voice, we should: 1) write policy that helps the values of voice and expression triumph around the world, 2)fend off the urge to define speech we don’t like as dangerous, and 3) build new institutions so companies like Facebook aren’t making so many important decisions about speech on our own.
Read Mark’s full speech below.
Hey everyone. It’s great to be here at Georgetown with all of you today.
Before we get started, I want to acknowledge that today we lost an icon, Elijah Cummings. He was a powerful voice for equality, social progress and bringing people together.
When I was in college, our country had just gone to war in Iraq. The mood on campus was disbelief. It felt like we were acting without hearing a lot of important perspectives. The toll on soldiers, families and our national psyche was severe, and most of us felt powerless to stop it. I remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently. Those early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.
Back then, I was building an early version of Facebook for my community, and I got to see my beliefs play out at smaller scale. When students got to express who they were and what mattered to them, they organized more social events, started more businesses, and even challenged some established ways of doing things on campus. It taught me that while the world’s attention focuses on major events and institutions, the bigger story is that most progress in our lives comes from regular people having more of a voice.
Since then, I’ve focused on building services to do two things: give people voice, and bring people together. These two simple ideas — voice and inclusion — go hand in hand. We’ve seen this throughout history, even if it doesn’t feel that way today. More people being able to share their perspectives has always been necessary to build a more inclusive society. And our mutual commitment to each other — that we hold each others’ right to express our views and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want — is how we make progress together.
But this view is increasingly being challenged. Some people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that’s dangerous. Today I want to talk about why, and some important choices we face around free expression.
Throughout history, we’ve seen how being able to use your voice helps people come together. We’ve seen this in the civil rights movement. Frederick Douglass once called free expression “the great moral renovator of society”. He said “slavery cannot tolerate free speech”. Civil rights leaders argued time and again that their protests were protected free expression, and one noted: “nearly all the cases involving the civil rights movement were decided on First Amendment grounds”.
We’ve seen this globally too, where the ability to speak freely has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide. The most repressive societies have always restricted speech the most — and when people are finally able to speak, they often call for change. This year alone, people have used their voices to end multiple long-running dictatorships in Northern Africa. And we’re already hearing from voices in those countries that had been excluded just because they were women, or they believed in democracy.
Our idea of free expression has become much broader over even the last 100 years. Many Americans know about the Enlightenment history and how we enshrined the First Amendment in our constitution, but fewer know how dramatically our cultural norms and legal protections have expanded, even in recent history.
The first Supreme Court case to seriously consider free speech and the First Amendment was in 1919, Schenk vs the United States. Back then, the First Amendment only applied to the federal government, and states could and often did restrict your right to speak. Our ability to call out things we felt were wrong also used to be much more restricted. Libel laws used to impose damages if you wrote something negative about someone, even if it was true. The standard later shifted so it became okay as long as you could prove your critique was true. We didn’t get the broad free speech protections we have now until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times vs Sullivan that you can criticize public figures as long as you’re not doing so with actual malice, even if what you’re saying is false.
We now have significantly broader power to call out things we feel are unjust and share our own personal experiences. Movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo went viral on Facebook — the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was actually first used on Facebook — and this just wouldn’t have been possible in the same way before. 100 years back, many of the stories people have shared would have been against the law to even write down. And without the internet giving people the power to share them directly, they certainly wouldn’t have reached as many people. With Facebook, more than 2 billion people now have a greater opportunity to express themselves and help others.
While it’s easy to focus on major social movements, it’s important to remember that most progress happens in our everyday lives. It’s the Air Force moms who started a Facebook group so their children and other service members who can’t get home for the holidays have a place to go. It’s the church group that came together during a hurricane to provide food and volunteer to help with recovery. It’s the small business on the corner that now has access to the same sophisticated tools only the big guys used to, and now they can get their voice out and reach more customers, create jobs and become a hub in their local community. Progress and social cohesion come from billions of stories like this around the world.
People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world — a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society. People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences. I understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralized power, but I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people’s hands. It’s part of this amazing expansion of voice through law, culture and technology.
So giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand, and the trend has been towards greater voice over time. But there’s also a counter-trend. In times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression. We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension.
We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully. We saw this in the efforts to shut down campus protests against the Vietnam War. We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I, and the Supreme Court ruled that socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech.
In the end, all of these decisions were wrong. Pulling back on free expression wasn’t the answer and, in fact, it often ended up hurting the minority views we seek to protect. From where we are now, it seems obvious that, of course, protests for civil rights or against wars should be allowed. Yet the desire to suppress this expression was felt deeply by much of society at the time.
Today, we are in another time of social tension. We face real issues that will take a long time to work through — massive economic transitions from globalization and technology, fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, and polarized reactions to greater migration. Many of our issues flow from these changes.
In the face of these tensions, once again a popular impulse is to pull back from free expression. We’re at another cross-roads. We can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. Or we can decide the cost is simply too great. I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.
At the same time, I know that free expression has never been absolute. Some people argue internet platforms should allow all expression protected by the First Amendment, even though the First Amendment explicitly doesn’t apply to companies. I’m proud that our values at Facebook are inspired by the American tradition, which is more supportive of free expression than anywhere else. But even American tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on others’ rights. And still, a strict First Amendment standard might require us to allow terrorist propaganda, bullying young people and more that almost everyone agrees we should stop — and I certainly do — as well as content like pornography that would make people uncomfortable using our platforms.
So once we’re taking this content down, the question is: where do you draw the line? Most people agree with the principles that you should be able to say things other people don’t like, but you shouldn’t be able to say things that put people in danger. The shift over the past several years is that many people would now argue that more speech is dangerous than would have before. This raises the question of exactly what counts as dangerous speech online. It’s worth examining this in detail.
Many arguments about online speech are related to new properties of the internet itself. If you believe the internet is completely different from everything before it, then it doesn’t make sense to focus on historical precedent. But we should be careful of overly broad arguments since they’ve been made about almost every new technology, from the printing press to radio to TV.

But inevitably some people will use their voice to organize violence, undermine elections or hurt others, and we have a responsibility to address these risks.

We build specific systems to address each type of harmful content — from incitement of violence to child exploitation to other harms like intellectual property violations — about 20 categories in total. We judge ourselves by the prevalence of harmful content and what percent we find proactively before anyone reports it to us. For example, our AI systems identify 99% of the terrorist content we take down before anyone even sees it. This is a massive investment. We now have over 35,000 people working on security, and our security budget today is greater than the entire revenue of our company at the time of our IPO earlier this decade.

Some people argue that virality itself is dangerous, and we need tighter filters on what content can spread quickly.
For misinformation, we focus on making sure complete hoaxes don’t go viral. We especially focus on misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, like misleading health advice saying if you’re having a stroke, no need to go to the hospital.

But we’ve also seen people broadcast self-harm, suicide, and terrible violence. These are new challenges and our responsibility is to build systems that can respond quickly.
We’re particularly focused on well-being, especially for young people. We built a team of thousands of people and AI systems that can detect risks of self-harm within minutes so we can reach out when people need help most. In the last year, we’ve helped first responders reach people who needed help thousands of times.
For each of these issues, I believe we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it could cause real danger as effectively as we can, and to fight to uphold as wide a definition of freedom of expression as possible — and not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary. That’s what I’m committed to.

Take misinformation. No one tells us they want to see misinformation. That’s why we work with independent fact checkers to stop hoaxes that are going viral from spreading.

And if content is newsworthy, we also won’t take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards.

I know many people disagree, but, in general, I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we’re not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads.

American tradition also has some precedent here. The Supreme Court case I mentioned earlier that gave us our current broad speech rights, New York Times vs Sullivan, was actually about an ad with misinformation, supporting Martin Luther King Jr. and criticizing an Alabama police department. The police commissioner sued the Times for running the ad, the jury in Alabama found against the Times, and the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the decision, creating today’s speech standard.
As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies. Of course there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don’t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm — and of course we don’t allow voter suppression. Voting is voice. Fighting voter suppression may be as important for the civil rights movement as free expression has been. Just as we’re inspired by the First Amendment, we’re inspired by the 15th Amendment too.

Given the sensitivity around political ads, I’ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether. From a business perspective, the controversy certainly isn’t worth the small part of our business they make up. But political ads are an important part of voice — especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.
Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it’s not clear where we’d draw the line. There are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women’s empowerment? If we banned candidates’ ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves? There are issues any way you cut this, and when it’s not absolutely clear what to do, I believe we should err on the side of greater expression.
Or take hate speech, which we define as someone directly attacking a person or group based on a characteristic like race, gender or religion. We take down content that could lead to real world violence. In countries at risk of conflict, that includes anything that could lead to imminent violence or genocide. And we know from history that dehumanizing people is the first step towards inciting violence. If you say immigrants are vermin, or all Muslims are terrorists — that makes others feel they can escalate and attack that group without consequences. So we don’t allow that. I take this incredibly seriously, and we work hard to get this off our platform.
American free speech tradition recognizes that some speech can have the effect of restricting others’ right to speak. While American law doesn’t recognize “hate speech” as a category, it does prohibit racial harassment and sexual harassment. We still have a strong culture of free expression even while our laws prohibit discrimination.
But still, people have broad disagreements over what qualifies as hate and shouldn’t be allowed. Some people think our policies don’t prohibit content they think qualifies as hate, while others think what we take down should be a protected form of expression. This area is one of the hardest to get right.
I believe people should be able to use our services to discuss issues they feel strongly about — from religion and immigration to foreign policy and crime. You should even be able to be critical of groups without dehumanizing them. But even this isn’t always straightforward to judge at scale, and it often leads to enforcement mistakes. Is someone re-posting a video of a racist attack because they’re condemning it, or glorifying and encouraging people to copy it? Are they using normal slang, or using an innocent word in a new way to incite violence? Now multiply those linguistic challenges by more than 100 languages around the world.
Rules about what you can and can’t say often have unintended consequences. When speech restrictions were implemented in the UK in the last century, parliament noted they were applied more heavily to citizens from poorer backgrounds because the way they expressed things didn’t match the elite Oxbridge style. In everything we do, we need to make sure we’re empowering people, not simply reinforcing existing institutions and power structures.
That brings us back to the cross-roads we all find ourselves at today. Will we continue fighting to give more people a voice to be heard, or will we pull back from free expression?
I see three major threats ahead:
The first is legal. We’re increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression and people’s human rights. These local laws are each individually troubling, especially when they shut down speech in places where there isn’t democracy or freedom of the press. But it’s even worse when countries try to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world.
This raises a larger question about the future of the global internet. China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries. Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There’s no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese.

We’re beginning to see this in social media. While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the US.
Is that the internet we want?
It’s one of the reasons we don’t operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China. I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society. I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in. And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.
This question of which nation’s values will determine what speech is allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective our debates about the content issues of the day. While we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree. That’s what free expression is. And the fact that we can even have this conversation means that we’re at least debating from some common values. If another nation’s platforms set the rules, our discourse will be defined by a completely different set of values.

To push back against this, as we all work to define internet policy and regulation to address public safety, we should also be proactive and write policy that helps the values of voice and expression triumph around the world.
The second challenge to expression is the platforms themselves — including us. Because the reality is we make a lot of decisions that affect people’s ability to speak.
I’m committed to the values we’re discussing today, but we won’t always get it right. I understand people are concerned that we have so much control over how they communicate on our services. And I understand people are concerned about bias and making sure their ideas are treated fairly. Frankly, I don’t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either. We’d benefit from a more democratic process, clearer rules for the internet, and new institutions.
That’s why we’re establishing an independent Oversight Board for people to appeal our content decisions. The board will have the power to make final binding decisions about whether content stays up or comes down on our services — decisions that our team and I can’t overturn. We’re going to appoint members to this board who have a diversity of views and backgrounds, but who each hold free expression as their paramount value.
Building this institution is important to me personally because I’m not always going to be here, and I want to ensure the values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed.
The third challenge to expression is the hardest because it comes from our culture. We’re at a moment of particular tension here and around the world — and we’re seeing the impulse to restrict speech and enforce new norms around what people can say.
Increasingly, we’re seeing people try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they see as unacceptable. Some hold the view that since the stakes are so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves.
I personally believe this is more dangerous for democracy over the long term than almost any speech. Democracy depends on the idea that we hold each others’ right to express ourselves and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want. You can’t impose tolerance top-down. It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a shared story for society that we all feel we’re a part of. That’s how we make progress together.

So how do we turn the tide? Someone once told me our founding fathers thought free expression was like air. You don’t miss it until it’s gone. When people don’t feel they can express themselves, they lose faith in democracy and they’re more likely to support populist parties that prioritize specific policy goals over the health of our democratic norms.
I’m a little more optimistic. I don’t think we need to lose our freedom of expression to realize how important it is. I think people understand and appreciate the voice they have now. At some fundamental level, I think most people believe in their fellow people too.
As long as our governments respect people’s right to express themselves, as long as our platforms live up to their responsibilities to support expression and prevent harm, and as long as we all commit to being open and making space for more perspectives, I think we’ll make progress. It’ll take time, but we’ll work through this moment. We overcame deep polarization after World War I, and intense political violence in the 1960s. Progress isn’t linear. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. But if we can’t agree to let each other talk about the issues, we can’t take the first step. Even when it’s hard, this is how we build a shared understanding.
So yes, we have big disagreements. Maybe more now than at any time in recent history. But part of that is because we’re getting our issues out on the table — issues that for a long time weren’t talked about. More people from more parts of our society have a voice than ever before, and it will take time to hear these voices and knit them together into a coherent narrative. Sometimes we hope for a singular event to resolve these conflicts, but that’s never been how it works. We focus on the major institutions — from governments to large companies — but the bigger story has always been regular people using their voice to take billions of individual steps forward to make our lives and our communities better.
The future depends on all of us. Whether you like Facebook or not, we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for free expression at this critical moment.
I believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people. And as long as enough of us keep fighting for this, I believe that more people’s voices will eventually help us work through these issues together and write a new chapter in our history — where from all of our individual voices and perspectives, we can bring the world closer together.

"Community Chatsin Messenger and Facebook allow people toconnect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about via text, audio or video.Messenger already helps more than a billion people stay connected to friends and family, and this feature helps people also connect with communities over shared interests.
Since they’re designed for more public conversations, we’re explaining our approach to making Community Chats trusted spaces.
Admins and moderators can manage their Community Chats with a robust suite ofcontent and moderation toolsto help keep people safe. Admin Assistallows them to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent.They can also manually delete messages, remove group members from chats and report messages to Meta.
Members of Community Chats can report a group, category, chat or message, and they can block people or leave a chat at any time. People who are blocked or removed from a group won’t be able to view its Community Chat content. If someone joins a chat with a person they’ve blocked on Facebook, they will be able to see that person’s content but will receive a pop-up notice that the person they’ve blocked is present.
Audio channels in Community Chats will follow the same standards as other Messenger audio calls, providing people with controls to manage their experience. This includes the ability to block or remove someone, and to report an audio channel or participant to both Facebook or an admin.
We know people will want to understand how they can protect their privacy, and it’s important to understand how and when you will be visible in a Community Chat. Any member of a Facebook Group can join its Community Chats and see their history, with the exception of admin-only or invite-only chats.Privateconversations should be reserved for private Messenger chats.
We will continue to respect your existing privacy settings in Community Chats, and private accounts will work the same way they do today. For example, your account’s name and basic profile information will be visible to other members of a Community Chat, but Feed content by private accounts will be visible only to friends or followers. If a member of a Community Chat sends you a private message on Messenger, those messages will adhere to your message delivery controls, which means you can decide whether the request is sent to your chats list, your message requests folder or whether you want to receive it at all.
Finally, as with other parts of Meta, we collect information from Messenger and Facebook primarily to provide the service, improve the product experience and keep people safe and secure. We’re always improving our data collection processes, as well as carefully monitoring and verifying how we use data. Learn more abouthow we collect and use information from Messenger and Facebook.
How we treat content and data in Community Chats is different from that of private messaging in Messenger. Given their more public nature, we use machine learning to detect and remove a wider breadth of potentially harmful content than in private Messenger chats, and we do not currently allow message forwarding from Community Chats.
While all chats are subject to Facebook’sCommunity Standards, Community Chats are subject to these policies regardless of whether they’ve been reported. This means Facebook may automatically take down violating content or media, and repeated content violations could lead to a suspension of the feature, a Facebook Group or a user’s account.And, Facebook content shared in Community Chats that has been rated sensitive or misleading will be labeled as such so people can better decide what to read, trust or share.

"By Collin Greene, Manager of Product Security
Billions of people use Facebook to connect with the people who matter to them. We have a responsibility to build secure services that help keep people safe.
At Facebook we take what’s called a “defense-in-depth” approach to security, meaning we layer a number of protections to make sure we prevent and address vulnerabilities in our code from multiple angles. It is a massive, ongoing effort that spans teams, departments and time zones. Security engineers and practices are embedded throughout the company to help ensure that data protections are built into our code and designs from the get-go, rather than added on at the end.
As it’s practically impossible to write flawless code, it’s not uncommon for software to have bugs. While most bugs don’t have serious consequences, some can create security vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited to gain access to data or user accounts. Because of this, Facebook is committed to finding, fixing and preventing those bugs. We work to continually improve our defenses so we can counter emerging threats and stay ahead of our adversaries, which means that this type of work is never finished.
In the graphic below, you can see how our “defense-in-depth” approach relies on a combination of technology, expert security teams and the wider security community to help protect our platform. In the following article, we’ll dive into each of these five components — secure frameworks, automated testing tools, peer and design reviews, red team exercises and our bug bounty program — in greater depth.

Secure frameworks:Reduce programming errors
Every engineer who joins Facebook goes through a comprehensive 6-week bootcamp, where they learn the foundational security processes described throughout this post.This ensures that our entire engineering workforce has training in information security.
We also invest heavily in building frameworks that help engineers prevent and remove entire classes of bugs when writing code. Frameworks are development building blocks, such as customized programming languages and libraries of common bits of code, that provide engineers with built-in safeguards as they write code.
One example of a framework we built is calledHack, an update of the popular programming language PHP. Hack helps developers avoid introducing errors by requiring them to explicitly define and type out certain variables and parameters in their code. The addition of this information allows the development software to flag potential errors as the developer is coding. You can think of these requirements like inflatable bumpers in a bowling alley: They channel and guide the actions a programmer can make, in effect limiting the number of errors that may be introduced. As a bonus, the additional information Hack developers must add to their code can make later analysis much easier and helps us develop the analysis tools we’ll describe in the next section. (Coders can read ourdeveloper blog post on Hack, which is open source, for more technical details.)
We also createdXHP, an open-source augmentation to PHP/Hack that helps engineers integrate PHP and HTML code more seamlessly, reducing the likelihood that errors will inadvertently be introduced into the code. This helps prevent a common type of problem known as across-site scripting vulnerability.
Hack and XHP are examples of secure frameworks that help ensure our engineers build technology that is more secure from the very beginning, rather than requiring they write additional code.
Automated testing tools:Analyze code non-stop, automatically and at scale
Since secure frameworks alone can’t anticipate and prevent all issues, we also invest in building analysis tools that can inspect code and find security errors at scale and as quickly as possible.
We are continually learning from security incidents that affect both Facebook and other technology companies, discovering new types of software vulnerabilities and then using this knowledge to prevent similar issues in the future. This is where our preventative and detection-based tools come in.
There are many differenttypesoftoolswedeployacross Facebook, including static analysis tools, which review written source code, and dynamic analysis tools, which run the code to observe errors as the program is running. These tools look for potential issues so they can either be fixed or flagged for further analysis.
No matter how we find a security bug, we respond by triaging the issue and then doing a root-cause analysis, which allows us to learn from each bug to prevent it — or errors like it — from occurring in the future. This analysis then feeds back into the other phases of our defense-in-depth approach. For example, it may lead to us building new coding frameworks, new tools or new training.
As an example, we built a unique tool that we regularly update to detect new types of bugs. That tool then continually analyzes Facebook’s entire codebase — currently more than 100 million lines ofHackcode — to identify these vulnerabilities. It would be incredibly time- and resource-intensive to continually monitor that much code, which changes thousands of times a day, with manual reviewers. This tool allows us to automatically audit our code for certain types of bugs on an ongoing basis.
Peer reviews, design reviews, red team exercises:Use human experts to find flaws technology misses
All code changes go through mandatory peer review in addition to the automated analysis described in the previous section. Certain new features will also undergo design reviews, in which Facebook’s security experts provide feedback to help engineers spot any deficiencies that could lead to security problems. These internal reviews provide another layer of scrutiny to help ensure we are following industry best practices.
To imagine how our products could be misused or attacked, we also run threat modeling exercises, in which we try to anticipate how malicious actors could abuse our systems or misuse our platform. We fix the issues that are surfaced in these exercises and also use these learnings to help design new coding frameworks and analysis tools.
The next layer in our defense-in-depth approach is to regularly test our protections, to verify that our code and our defense mechanisms are behaving as intended and that our response teams are ready and able to detect and investigate attacks. To do that, we have a so-called “red team” of internal security experts who plan and execute staged “attacks” on our systems. These unannounced exercises help provide us a realistic picture of our readiness as we stress-test our systems and processes.
We then take the red team’s findings and, along with other partner teams across the company, map out how we would respond to a similar security incident in what’s known as a “table-top” exercise. This helps us improve the coordination between our teams working on security, privacy, public policy, communications, product and legal and helps us exercise the organizational muscles we would need during a real incident.
Bug bounty program:Engage the global security community
As we face many of the same security challenges as the rest of the technology industry, we have long invested in sharing our tools and knowledge so we can improve our community’s collective defense. In turn, outside information security experts provide their expertise to us through Facebook’s bug bounty program, one of the longest running in the industry.
Since 2011, we haveencouragedsecurity researchers to responsibly disclose potential issues so we can fix the bugs, publicly recognize their work and pay them a bounty. Our bug bounty program has been instrumental in helping us quickly detect new bugs, spot trends and engage the best security talent outside of Facebook to help us keep the platform safe. The lessons learned from each report feed back into our larger security effort, making us better and faster at finding, fixing and preventing bugs. To date, we have paid over$7.5 million in bountiesto researchers from more than 100 countries. We continue to innovate in this area by expanding the bug bounty program to include issues that can lead todata abuseand compromises ofthird-party appson the platform.
A unique mission to protect over 2 billion people on Facebook
Supporting our global community is a great responsibility that has driven continuous improvement and investment in our security technology and talent. Our focus on finding, fixing and preventing security issues has allowed us to scale our defenses as Facebook has grown to support billions of people connecting with one another. At times this has meant adapting our strategies to protect our expanding global community, rewriting our widely-used coding frameworks and open-sourcing unique security tools. And because we know that security work is never 100% finished, our security team will continue to innovate as the Facebook community grows.",,,,Designing Security for Billions,"January 25, 2019",,"August 29, 2022",,en-en,"Security News, Data and Privacy, Inside Feed, Integrity and Security",en,English,,,"By Collin Greene, Manager of Product Security

"Today, Microsoft and Snap are excited to announce the integration of Snapchat Lenses for Teams, for the 280 million people who use the collaboration platform monthly. Lenses offer personal, engaging ways to participate and work together, while adding some humor and interactivity that brightens everyone’s day through augmented reality (cue the AR sunglasses!). This integration is made possible by Camera Kit, Snap’s SDK that allows partners to leverage Snap’s AR technology in their own applications and websites. During Teams meetings, a rotating collection of 26 popular Lenses will be available, from clever to creative. Lenses that transform you into a cartoon character, add fun backgrounds to your video, and even bring falling snow into your office. Make your meetings unique with new ways to break the ice and get creative juices flowing during your next project kickoff through AR. There are no additional downloads needed to find a Lens that suits your personality and sense of humor. To get started, click on ‘Video effects’ and select the 'Snapchat' tab to start exploring. This is Microsoft’s second integration with Camera Kit. They’ve also used Camera Kit to bring Snap AR into Flip, Microsoft’s video learning platform where educators can post topic prompts to spark video discussions among students. Since adding Snap AR to their Flip web experience, there has been a 60% increase in students and teachers creating videos. We’ve continued to work closely with new partners to integrate Camera Kit and develop new use cases for AR.

"Récemment, il y a eu des spéculations concernant le stockage des Snaps et la date et la manière dont ils sont supprimés. Nous avons toujours essayé d'être le plus transparent possible en ce qui concerne le fonctionnement des choses et nous n'avons pas modifié nos pratiques, nous avons donc pensé que ce serait une bonne idée d'expliquer les choses plus en détail. Le stockage de Snaps Lorsque quelqu'un envoie un Snap, il est téléchargé dans nos serveurs, le ou les destinataires reçoivent une notification indiquant qu'ils ont un nouveau Snap et l'application Snapchat télécharge un exemplaire du message. L'image ou la vidéo du message est stockée dans un dossier temporaire dans la mémoire de l'appareil. Il s'agit parfois de la mémoire interne, de la mémoire vive ou de la mémoire externe comme une carte SD, en fonction de la plateforme et du fait qu'il s'agisse d'une vidéo ou d'une image. La suppression des Snaps dans nos serveurs Lorsque un Snap est vu et que le minuteur s'épuise, l'application notifie nos serveurs, qui, à leur tour, notifient l'expéditeur que le Snap a été ouvert. Une fois que nous avons été informés qu'un Snap a été ouvert par tous ses destinataires, il est supprimé de nos serveurs. Si un Snap n'est pas ouvert après 30 jours, il est également supprimé de nos serveurs. La suppression des Snaps dans l'appareil du destinataire Après l'ouverture d'un Snap, sa copie temporaire est supprimée du stockage de l'appareil. Nous essayons de faire en sorte que cela se fasse immédiatement, parfois cela peut prendre une minute ou deux. Les fichiers sont supprimés en envoyant une instruction ""supprimer"" dans le système de fichiers du téléphone. C'est la méthode habituelle de suppression d'éléments sur les ordinateurs et les téléphones—nous ne faisons rien de spécial (comme "" effacer ""). Détails supplémentaires Alors qu'un Snap non ouvert est stocké sur l'appareil, il n'est pas impossible de contourner l'application Snapchat et d'accéder directement aux fichiers. Ce n'est pas une chose que nous vous recommandons ou que nous encourageons, et dans la plupart des cas, cela impliquerait le débridage ou de déverouiller le téléphone et annulerait la garantie. Si vous essayez d'enregistrer un Snap, il serait plus facile (et plus sûr) de prendre une capture d'écran ou de prendre une photo avec un autre appareil photo. De plus, si vous avez déjà essayé de récupérer des données perdues après avoir accidentellement supprimé un lecteur ou après avoir regardé un épisode CSI : Les Experts, vous devriez savoir que grâce aux bons outils médico-légaux, il est parfois possible de récupérer des données après leurs suppressions. Alors… maintenant vous le savez… gardez cela à l'esprit avant de mettre des secrets d'État dans vos selfies :)",,,,Comment les Snaps sont stockés et supprimés,09 mai 2013,,,,fr-FR - de-DE - pt-BR - ko-KR - ja-JP - it-IT,,fr,France,How Snaps are stored and deleted,"Recently, there have been speculations regarding the storage of Snaps and the date and manner in which they are deleted. We have always tried to be as transparent as possible about how things work, and we have not changed our practices, so we thought it would be a good idea to explain things in more detail. Storage of Snaps When someone sends a Snap, it is uploaded to our servers, the recipient(s) receive a notification indicating that they have a new Snap, and the Snapchat application downloads a copy of the message. The image or video of the message is stored in a temporary folder in the device's memory. This can be the internal memory, the RAM, or external memory like an SD card, depending on the platform and whether it is a video or an image. Deletion of Snaps on our servers When a Snap is viewed and the timer runs out, the application notifies our servers, which in turn notify the sender that the Snap has been opened. Once we have been informed that a Snap has been opened by all its recipients, it is deleted from our servers. If a Snap is not opened after 30 days, it is also deleted from our servers. Deletion of Snaps on the recipient's device After opening a Snap, its temporary copy is deleted from the device's storage. We try to make this happen immediately, but sometimes it can take a minute or two. The files are deleted by sending a ""delete"" instruction in the phone's file system. This is the usual method of deleting items on computers and phones—we don't do anything special (like ""erase""). Additional details While an unopened Snap is stored on the device, it is not impossible to bypass the Snapchat application and directly access the files. This is not something we recommend or encourage, and in most cases, it would involve jailbreaking or unlocking the phone and voiding the warranty. If you try to save a Snap, it would be easier (and safer) to take a screenshot or use another camera to take a photo. Also, if you have ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or after watching an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, you should know that with the right forensic tools, it is sometimes possible to recover data after deletion. So... now you know... keep that in mind before putting state secrets in your selfies :)","Recently, there have been speculations regarding the storage of Snaps and the date and manner in which they are deleted.

"For years, video screens have been a canvas for visual expression at concerts and festivals around the world. They help artists tell their stories and bring music to life. We believe Snap’s augmented reality offers artists an incredible new creative tool that will change the way fans experience their performances. Today we’re excited to announce a new multi-year partnership with Live Nation that will elevate performances beyond stages and screens - creating a deeper connection between artists and fans - through custom-built, immersive AR with help from Snap Inc. ’s creative studio Arcadia . Fans can open the Snapchat Camera at select concerts for AR experiences that are seamlessly built into the experience of attending a  show, extending the artist’s creative canvas into the crowd and helping create moments that are unique and memorable. At festivals, attendees will be able to use AR to try on merchandise, find friends, and discover exclusive landmarks around the festival grounds. From Lollapalooza in Chicago and Wireless Festival in London, to Rolling Loud in Miami and The Governors Ball in New York, festivals will be enhanced through Snap AR in the coming year.

"At Snap, privacy, safety, and transparency have always been core to how we operate. We have protections in place for all members of our community and offer additional safeguards for our teenage Snapchatters. Our long standing values are aligned with the principles of the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and we share their goals to create a safe online environment. We are fully committing to ensuring we meet our DSA requirements by August 25, and are making a number of updates for our Snapchatters in the European Union (EU), including: 1. Giving Snapchatters the ability to control the content they’re shown. Snapchat is primarily a visual messaging platform. There are two parts of Snapchat where we show public content that could reach a large audience - the Discover section of the Stories tab and the Spotlight tab. The content shown in these sections is personalised to the viewer, ensuring that people have an experience that is relevant for them. We are transparent about what content is eligible to be shown to our community - and we set a higher bar for content that is eligible to be recommended. As part of our DSA response, all Snapchatters in the EU will now have the ability to better understand why content is being shown to them and have the ability to opt out of a personalised Discover and Spotlight content experience. We have developed a simple guide to describe how personalisation works on Snapchat. 2. A new notification and appeals process for content or account removals We have strict community guidelines that we expect everyone to follow when using Snapchat. Anyone can easily report content or accounts that they think violate these guidelines through our in-app or online reporting tools. We will now be notifying people with information as to why their account and certain content has been removed and easily allow them to appeal the decision. These features will initially be available to Snapchatters in the EU before rolling out to our global community over the coming months. As part of the DSA, we have also been building an integration to the European Commission’s Transparency API, which will provide certain information about enforcement decisions that have been made about EU based accounts or content. 3. Updating our advertising As we announced earlier in the month, we have been making a number of updates to our advertising for Snapchatters in the EU and UK, including: Restricting personalised advertising for Snapchatters aged 13 - 17 in the EU and UK - Most targeting and optimisation tools will no longer be available for advertisers to personalise ads for Snapchatters in the EU and UK under the age of 18. Now, personalisation of ads to these Snapchatters will be limited to basic essential information, like language settings, age and location. Offering Snapchatters in the EU aged 18+ a new level of advertising transparency and control - tapping on the “why am I seeing this ad” will now give Snapchatters in the EU more details about why that ad was shown to them and these Snapchatters will now also be able to limit personalisation of ads shown to them. This adds to the existing advertising controls all Snapchatters have had such as the ability to hide some types of ads in the ads menu and to edit the Snap lifestyle interest categories allocated to them. Creating a library for EU targeted advertisements - Anyone can search this digital library of adverts shown in the EU and they can see details of paid advertising campaigns such as who paid for the ad, a visual of the creative, campaign length, impressions broken down by EU country and information about the targeting applied. 4. Committed to compliance To ensure we remain DSA compliant we have appointed DSA compliance officers who will be responsible for overseeing our DSA requirements and monitor compliance across multiple parts of the business. Fundamentally, we believe regulation is no substitute for businesses doing the right thing and taking responsibility for their products and platforms That’s why we’ve always taken a safety and privacy by design approach to how we build our platforms and features, and we are committed to being a platform where people can safely connect, express themselves visually, and have fun together.",,,,New features and transparency measures for Snapchatters in the European Union to comply with the Digital Services Act,"August 23, 2023",,,,de-DE - pt-BR - fr-FR - en-US - it-IT - ko-KR - es-ES - ja-JP,,en,USA,,,"At Snap, privacy, safety, and transparency have always been core to how we operate.

"As we continue to mark Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, we’ve released a number of new creative tools and content to celebrate the vibrant cultures, accomplishments, languages and histories of APIDA communities as well as the diversity of our Snapchatters. To honor the diversity of APIDA experiences, we teamed up with a number of APIDA creatives including Jiqai Wang , Badal Patel and Rachel Newman to develop a series of “I Am APIDA'' Lenses to uplift Snapchatters and encourage them to express themselves and their identities. We’re also releasing additional Lenses, Filters and the APIDA Pride Sticker Pack to allow Snapchatters to celebrate their heritage within the many countries, languages and cultures that make up the APIDA community. We are committed to ensuring our shows are reflective of our community’s diverse voices, passions, and the issues they care about. Later this month we’re releasing a new Snap Original Series, “As I Am” which is a first person series about Asian-Americans, meant to challenge and break down stereotypes, address ongoing discrimination, hate crimes and terrorism, while also shedding light on and celebrating the diverse array of experiences Asian-American people have today. The weekly series produced by Barcroft Studios and Calico will be available later this month with new episodes launching weekly, only on Snapchat’s Discover. As we celebrate APIDA Heritage Month, it’s also important to acknowledge the long history of violence, racism and discrimination against APIDA communities and the work that lies ahead to have a safe and equitable society for everyone. At Snap, we take pride in the diversity of our community and we’re committed to continuing to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in our own systems and beyond.

At Snap, we take pride in the diversity of our community and we’re committed to continuing to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in our own systems and beyond.

"Six weeks ago, we rolled out My AI , a chatbot built with OpenAI’s GPT technology. We started slowly by providing My AI to Snapchat+ subscribers and, in a little over a month, we have learned a lot. For example, we know some of the most common topics our community has asked My AI about include movies, sports, games, pets, and math. We have also learned about some of the potential for misuse, many of which we learned from people trying to trick the chatbot into providing responses that do not conform to our guidelines. As part of our joint work to improve My AI, we want to share an update on some of the safety enhancements we have recently put in place as a result of our learnings — along with new tools we plan to implement. My AI’s Approach to Data Privacy has always been central to Snap’s mission — it helps people feel more comfortable expressing themselves when communicating with friends and family. Across Snapchat, we try to provide our community with clarity and context about how our products use data and how we build features using privacy-by-design processes. For example, the way we handle data related to conversations between friends on Snapchat is different from how we handle data related to broadcast content on Snapchat, which we hold to a higher standard and require to be moderated because it reaches a large audience. However, since My AI is a chatbot and not a real friend, we have been deliberate in treating the associated data differently, because we are able to use the conversation history to continue to make My AI more fun, useful, and safer. Before Snapchatters are allowed to use My AI, we show them an onboarding message that makes clear that all messages with My AI will be retained unless you delete them. Being able to review these early interactions with My AI has helped us identify which guardrails are working well and which need to be made stronger. To help assess this, we have been running reviews of the My AI queries and responses that contain “non-conforming” language, which we define as any text that includes references to violence, sexually explicit terms, illicit drug use, child sexual abuse, bullying, hate speech, derogatory or biased statements, racism, misogyny, or marginalizing underrepresented groups. All of these categories of content are explicitly prohibited on Snapchat. Our most recent analysis found that only 0.01% of My AI’s responses were deemed non-conforming. Examples of the most common non-conforming My AI responses included My AI repeating inappropriate words in response to Snapchatters’ questions. We will continue to use these learnings to improve My AI. This data will also help us deploy a new system to limit misuse of My AI. We are adding Open AI’s moderation technology to our existing toolset, which will allow us to assess the severity of potentially harmful content and temporarily restrict Snapchatters’ access to My AI if they misuse the service. Age-Appropriate Experiences We take seriously our responsibility to design products and experiences that prioritize safety and age appropriateness. Since launching My AI, we have worked vigorously to improve its responses to inappropriate Snapchatter requests, regardless of a Snapchatter’s age. We also use proactive detection tools to scan My AI conversations for potentially nonconforming text and take action. We have also implemented a new age signal for My AI utilizing a Snapchatter’s birthdate, so that even if a Snapchatter never tells My AI their age in a conversation, the chatbot will consistently take their age into consideration when engaging in conversation. My AI in Family Center Snapchat offers parents and caregivers visibility into which friends their teens are communicating with, and how recently, through our in-app Family Center. In the coming weeks, we will provide parents with more insight into their teens’ interactions with My AI. This means parents will be able to use Family Center to see if their teens are communicating with My AI, and how often. In order to use Family Center, both a parent and a teen need to opt in — and interested families can learn more about how to sign up here . We continue to encourage Snapchatters to use our in-app reporting tools if they receive any concerning responses from My AI and to submit feedback to us about their overall experiences with the product. We are constantly working to improve My AI, and we will continually evaluate additional measures to help keep our community safe. We appreciate all of the early feedback on My AI, and we are committed to providing a fun and safe experience for our community.",,,,Early Learnings from My AI and New Safety Enhancements,"April 4, 2023",,,,de-DE - en-US - it-IT - ko-KR - es-ES,,en,USA,,,"Six weeks ago, we rolled out My AI , a chatbot built with OpenAI’s GPT technology.

"Today, we’re launching a new augmented reality experience created in close collaboration with renowned artist Damien Hirst. Inspired by his Spin paintings , this globally available Snapchat lens allows everyone to make their own spin paintings, right from home. Pour virtual paint as your canvas spins to make millions of possible creations. Hirst first experimented with spin art in 1992 at his studio in Brixton, London, and began his Spin Painting series in 1994 while living in Berlin. At the first exhibition of Hirst’s machine-made spin drawings, visitors were invited to make their own drawings on a spin machine, democratizing the experience of making art. Now, our community worldwide can try their hand at this iconic art through the lens of Snapchat’s camera. We’ve also teamed up with Partners in Health on this experience to support their COVID-19 relief efforts. They’re a social justice organization working to support vulnerable communities during the pandemic and provide care for millions of patients worldwide.

"People around the world use Twitter to raise awareness about the climate crisis, organize for change in their communities, and connect with others passionate about protecting our planet. Ahead of World Environment Day, we’re partnering with organizations committed to tackling climate change and making it easier to find credible climate information from global experts. This week, we took additional steps to better serve the climate conversation happening across Twitter. We know that people use the service to find credible information during global crises. Starting this week, you can follow the Climate ChangeTopicto find personalized conversations about climate change, including Tweets from environmental and sustainability organizations, environmental activists, and scientists. These Tweets will appear right in your home timeline when you follow the Topic. Addressing the climate emergency requires collaboration, community, and widespread mobilization. Through #AdsForGood grants, events, on-service support, and trainings, we’re partnering with organizations promoting and amplifying environmental conservation and sustainability. These includeEarth Day Network,United Nations (UN) Environment Programme,UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,UN Development Programme,Greenpeace,Voice for the Planet,Let Me Breathe,WWF,350.org,FridaysForFuture,We Don’t Have Time,Climate Reality Project, and others. We’ve also made new environmental commitments and expanded Twitter’s sustainability efforts. In partnership with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), we’ve committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, paving the way for our net-zero journey. We recognize that transparency and accountability should be central to our approach to sustainability. We’re excited about the SBTi pledge because it advances Twitter’s environmental efforts in a clear and measurable way. We’re committed to protecting the environment, reducing our carbon footprint, and using our service to make a positive difference in the world. We continue to work toward our goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. We’ve partnered with Cool Effect, a nonprofit organization that helps offset emissions from our data centers and employee travel, to fund green projects around the world. So far, 92% of our global offices have achieved the ""Green Building Certified"" standard, with more to come. We’re mobilizing our workforce around the globe to participate and to make change at Twitter, but we know there’s more to do. That’s why, we’re ramping up our sustainability goals company-wide. How can you participate? We all have a part we can play in tackling this global crisis. From volunteering with an environmental organization in your community, to learning more about protecting our planet, there are lots of ways to get involved. Promote sustainable causes and ideas, advocate to your elected representatives, and join the conversation. Every little bit matters.

To do this, we need to make it easier for everyone to join in and provide more relevant experiences for people across the world. Today, in line with our growth strategy, we’re excited to announce that we are now actively building a team in Ghana. To truly serve the public conversation, we must be more immersed in the rich and vibrant communities that drive the conversations taking place every day across the African continent. We are looking for specialists to join several teams including product, design, engineering, marketing and communications. Full details on current job openings can be found on theTwitter Careers site. Aligned with our existing WFH policies, we look forward to welcoming and onboarding our new team members remotely so that we can make an immediate impact while we explore the opportunity to open an office in Ghana in the future. Why Ghana? As a champion for democracy, Ghana is a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate. Furthermore, Ghana’s recent appointment to hostThe Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Areaaligns with our overarching goal to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa. Whenever we enter new markets, we work hard to ensure that we are not just investing in the talent that we hire, but also investing in local communities and the social fabric that supports them. We have already laid foundations through partnerships withAmref Health Africain Kenya,Afrochellain Ghana,Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)in Nigeria, andThe HackLab Foundationin Ghana. As part of our long-term commitment to the region, we’ll continue to explore compelling ways we can use the positive power of Twitter to strengthen our communities through employee engagement, platform activation, and corporate giving. We still have much to learn but we are excited to listen, learn, and engage. Public conversation is essential to solving problems, building shared ideas, and pushing us all forward together.

"Brevity is the soul of Twitter. Today we're introducing an easy way to Tweet that brief moment of what matters from longer, live videos. Sometimes, we want to draw attention to the specific moment in a live video that made us think, surprised us, or made us laugh. Previously, we could only Tweet an entire live video, which made it difficult to discuss what matters most. We saw people Tweeting with the specific time in the video directing us to the part they wanted us to watch. So, we built Timestamps which lets anyone Tweet a live or replay video starting from the exact moment they want to discuss. Sharing Timestamps is easy. When you tap to share a live video, you can easily slide back to the exact time you want your audience to watch. From there, add your thoughts, and Tweet it to the world.  Anyone seeing your Tweet will start watching at the time within the video you shared. If the broadcast is still live, they can easily skip to what’s happening by tapping “live” at any time. The feature is available for any live video, whether from a professional content publisher or someone broadcasting from their phone. People have always used Twitter to talk about the things they experience. With Timestamps, now we can show rather than just tell everyone what’s happening. This update is rolling out today on Twitter for Android and iOS, Twitter.com and Periscope; read more about how to share from Periscopehere.",,,,Introducing Timestamps: A new way to share live videos,"Thursday, 29 March 2018",,,,en-en,,en,English,,,"Brevity is the soul of Twitter.

"Today we launched another global expansion of our#ThereIsHelpnotification service with a dedicated search prompt for HIV-related information across Asia Pacific and the Americas: Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, SP-Latam, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. This notification prompt will provide valuable and authoritative resources around HIV and encourage people to reach out and get help when they need it. Building on our #ThereIsHelp notification service currently available formental health and suicide prevention,vaccination,child sexual exploitation,COVID-19,gender-based violence, andfreedom of expression; this work is part of our efforts to ensure people have access to high-quality public health information and resources. When people search for keywords associated with HIV, the top search result will now include a notification in local languages, encouraging them to reach out for credible information and sources of help — be it websites or hotlines of local public health authorities or nonprofit organizations. Twitter will continue to work closely with public health authorities and leading NGOs that provide critical emergency care, testing, emotional support, and counselling services to ensure that the keywords that generate the notification prompt remain relevant. Some of the search keywords include but are not limited to: We’re committed to protecting the health of the public conversation on Twitter — ensuring individuals can find credible information from authoritative sources is a key part of that mission. We also recognized that it is crucial for the public to have access to a free and#OpenInternetin combating the stigma around HIV. Therefore, we are partnering with public health authorities and local nonprofit organizations across Asia Pacific and the Americas to provide people with access to accurate information about HIV via launching a dedicated#ThereisHelpnotification prompt for HIV. HIV stigma during COVID-19HIV remains a major issue to public health in 2021, despite significant progress having been made in recent decades. Division and disparity for human rights have long been the contributing factors to the difficulty faced by people living with HIV. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult byexacerbating inequities and disruptions to services related to HIV. In 2020, around800,000 children aged 0-14 years were living with HIV with no access to HIV treatments. This year’s theme of World AIDS Day is“End inequalities. End AIDS.”with a special focus on highlighting the growing inequalities in access to essential HIV services.WHO is callingon global leaders and citizens to rally to confront the inequalities that drive AIDS and to reach people who are currently not receiving essential HIV services. Data from Twitter shows that conversations about HIV spikes around#WorldAIDSDayon December 1 every year. In 2020, there were close to 9 million Tweets about HIV globally, out of which over 1 million Tweets were generated in December 2020. At Twitter, we recognize our role and responsibility to help ensure that people can access and receive support on our service when they need it the most. The various communities on Twitter are a source of positive support and are thriving; encouraging each other who may be struggling with stigma or lack of information around HIV, and to reach out for professional help. United to help provide more access to informationWe recognize that access to a free and#OpenInternetand collaboration — public, private and community — is the key to combating the stigma around HIV. As local organizations continue to use Twitter as a channel to identify and reach out to vulnerable people who they may otherwise not have contact with, and to raise awareness of their important services; we hope that the #ThereIsHelp notification service will complement these efforts. Below are our trusted NGO and government partners in this initiative that have made the #ThereIsHelp HIV notification prompt possible in30 markets and in 12 languages.We will continue to expand these prompts in other markets in the near future. #WorldAIDSDay EmojiIn partnership with UNAIDS (@UNAIDS), we are also launching a special red ribbon emoji to raise awareness of HIV.

"Feeling safe on Twitter looks different for everyone. We’ve rolled outfeaturesandsettingsthat may help you to feel more comfortable and in control of your experience, and we want to do more to reduce the burden on people dealing with unwelcome interactions. Unwelcome Tweets and noise can get in the way of conversations on Twitter, so we’re introducing Safety Mode, a new feature that aims to reduce disruptive interactions. Starting today, we’re rolling out this safety feature to a small feedback group on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com, beginning with accounts that have English-language settings enabled. Here’s how it works Safety Mode is a feature that temporarily blocks accounts for seven days for using potentially harmful language — such as insults or hateful remarks — or sending repetitive and uninvited replies or mentions. When the feature is turned on in your Settings, our systems will assess the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering both the Tweet’s content and the relationship between the Tweet author and replier. Our technology takes existing relationships into account, so accounts you follow or frequently interact with will not be autoblocked. Authors of Tweets found by our technology to be harmful or uninvited will be autoblocked, meaning they’ll temporarily be unable to follow your account, see your Tweets, or send you Direct Messages. You can find information about the Tweets flagged through Safety Mode and view the details of temporarily blocked accounts at any time. Before each Safety Mode period ends, you’ll receive a notification recapping this information. We won’t always get this right and may make mistakes, so Safety Mode autoblocks can be seen and undone at any time in your Settings. We’ll also regularly monitor the accuracy of our Safety Mode systems to make improvements to our detection capabilities. How we got here We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we're limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations. Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks. Throughout the product development process, we conducted several listening and feedback sessions for trusted partners with expertise in online safety, mental health, and human rights, including members of ourTrust and Safety Council. Their feedback influenced adjustments to make Safety Mode easier to use and helped us think through ways to address the potential manipulation of our technology. These trusted partners also played an important role in nominating Twitter account owners to join the feedback group, prioritizing people from marginalized communities and female journalists. We also committed to theWorld Wide Web Foundation’s framework to end online gender-based violence and participated in a series of discussions to explore new ways for women to customize their experience with safety online using features like Safety Mode. What’s next We’ll observe how Safety Mode is working and incorporate improvements and adjustments before bringing it to everyone on Twitter.

"#SB52 is what’s happening. There’s no better place than Twitter to reach consumers during major live moments - and the Super Bowl is no exception.

"As Susan mentioned in her April Creator Letter , we’re making it easier for creators to understand and remove manually claimed content in their videos.

We’ve heard from creators that the recent uptick of manual claims, especially for short segments, has led to some confusion, as the claims sometimes lack key information that can help to resolve the issue.

While it’s important that creators understand and respect copyright, it’s also important that they have knowledge of who is claiming content in their videos, where it appears, and what they can do about it.

Starting today, we will require copyright owners to provide timestamps to indicate exactly where their content appears in videos they manually claim, and we’re improving our video editing tools in Creator Studio to make it easier for creators to remove the content associated with these claims.

Manual Claiming is a tool within Content ID that allows select copyright owners to manually make claims on videos that were not automatically made by our Content ID matching system.

Previously, we did not require copyright owners using the Manual Claiming tool to provide timestamps, so it was sometimes unclear to creators which parts of their videos were being claimed and in addition, unlike edits that removed content identified by automated claims, the claims wouldn’t be automatically released.

We’re making the experience better for you in two important ways: 1.

Copyright owners must now provide timestamps for exactly what part of your video is being manually claimed.

Just as you would if you receive an automatic claim from our Content ID matching system, you’ll now see timestamps in Creator Studio when you get a manual claim.

Check out the Video Copyright Info page in YouTube Studio that offers a visualization of where the manually-claimed content appears in your video, and also, it provides more info about the content being claimed.

We’ll be evaluating the accuracy of these timestamps.

Copyright owners who repeatedly fail to provide accurate data will have their access to manual claiming revoked.

2.

You can use our editing tools to remove the content claimed manually in your video which will now automatically release the claims.

We’ve updated our editing tools to make it easier to remove manually claimed content from your video.

If you choose to remove the content, the claim will now be released automatically.

Below are some of the options you have without having to edit and upload a new video: Mute all sound when the claimed song plays: If you get a claim for a piece of music in your video, you can now mute the time-stamped segment.

Replace the song: If you don’t want to mute the audio entirely, you can instead swap out the music with one of our free-to-use songs from the YouTube Audio Library .

We also added new visual indicators below the video player, which show exactly what segment of the video is claimed.

This can help you position the audio track in such a way that will remove the claims from your video.

Trim out the content: You also have the option to cut out the time-stamped segment from your video using the Trim feature in the YouTube Editor.

We’re still working on several improvements here, like having an explicit Trim option in the Video Copyright Info page that will allow you to trim out the claimed content with just one click.

You can learn more about these changes in our Help Center.

Remember, if you receive a claim that you believe is incorrect, you have the right to dispute it.

You know the most about the content in your videos and whether it was used appropriately, so we built the dispute process to empower you to escalate any problems to the copyright owner, and even as far as the courts, if you choose.

If both you and the person claiming your video are attempting to monetize it, we will continue to show ads on the video during the dispute process and make sure the appropriate party gets the revenue once the dispute is resolved.

Our work won’t stop here.

We’re always looking to find ways to improve the creator copyright experience while also balancing the rights of copyright owners.

Stay tuned for more to come.",,,,More information and better tools to resolve manual Content ID claims,20190709,,,,en-en,products and features,en,Global/Other,,,"As Susan mentioned in her April Creator Letter , we’re making it easier for creators to understand and remove manually claimed content in their videos.

Below are some of the options you have without having to edit and upload a new video: Mute all sound when the claimed song plays: If you get a claim for a piece of music in your video, you can now mute the time-stamped segment.

Replace the song: If you don’t want to mute the audio entirely, you can instead swap out the music with one of our free-to-use songs from the YouTube Audio Library .

We also added new visual indicators below the video player, which show exactly what segment of the video is claimed.

This can help you position the audio track in such a way that will remove the claims from your video.

Trim out the content: You also have the option to cut out the time-stamped segment from your video using the Trim feature in the YouTube Editor.

We’re still working on several improvements here, like having an explicit Trim option in the Video Copyright Info page that will allow you to trim out the claimed content with just one click.

You can learn more about these changes in our Help Center.

Remember, if you receive a claim that you believe is incorrect, you have the right to dispute it.

You know the most about the content in your videos and whether it was used appropriately, so we built the dispute process to empower you to escalate any problems to the copyright owner, and even as far as the courts, if you choose.

If both you and the person claiming your video are attempting to monetize it, we will continue to show ads on the video during the dispute process and make sure the appropriate party gets the revenue once the dispute is resolved.

Our work won’t stop here.

We’re always looking to find ways to improve the creator copyright experience while also balancing the rights of copyright owners.

"Parents and caretakers, We know this isn’t the easiest time for you.

You’re juggling work, life, kids and the state of the world today.

The struggle is real.

Honestly, there’s an 11-year-old child, asking for my help, as I type this.

That’s why we’re hosting Camp YouTube : a digital learning experience to help parents recreate the fun of summer camp at home.

With Google searches for “virtual summer camps” spiking over the past few weeks, we want to help parents structure this new normal.

Starting today, Camp YouTube will spotlight content on the Learn@Home site and YouTube Kids across beloved summer camp themes, such as arts, adventure, sports, STEM, and more.

We’ll have over 1,200 videos programmed during this two-week period with content refreshed every weekday through Sunday, July 5.

We’ve made sure there’s something for everyone.

FOR THE ADVENTURE LOVER If you’re looking to bring the outside in, we’ll have an adventure camp that will help you explore the world around you and appreciate nature.

Teenagers can enjoy wildlife, unscripted and unedited, with Explore.org ; learn how to examine the outdoors the way scientists do when they’re doing fieldwork with The Brain Scoop or discover dinosaur fossils and organisms from all over the planet with the American Museum of Natural History .

We’ll also have a dedicated section for families with kids under 13 across each camp theme, where parents and kids can watch summer camp-themed videos on YouTube Kids that encourage creativity, curiosity, playfulness and offline activities.

For adventure camp, families can discover how to make a tide pool aquarium in their backyard with Brave Wilderness , learn how to best prep for a hike with PLUM LANDING or find their animal soulmates from Dodo Kids FOR THE ARTS LOVER For those looking to be creative, we’ll have an arts camp focused on self-expression and talent-building.

With arts camp, the teenagers in your household will be able to cover everything from art history, dance and music; to acting, songwriting and drawing, including a creative-writing workshop from TED-Ed.

And for those under the age of 13, families can tune in to YouTube Kids to express their creativity with Art for Kids Hub , make art with household items while learning art history with the ArtistYear or practice ballet for beginners with NANI NANI KIDS .

If music is your passion, you and your kids can learn dance moves together with KIDZ BOP FOR THE SPORTS LOVER There will also be a number of videos focused on sports and wellness from soccer, football and baseball to yoga, meditation and stretching.

With the help of the WNBA and NBA community, the Jr.

NBA has developed two youth basketball development camps, one for kids ages 13 and younger that features beginner basketball exercises and drills, and one for teenagers that features intermediate and advanced training.

FOR THE STEM LOVER We’ll also have a STEM camp for those interested in science, space, coding and more.

For teenagers, STEM camp will have a number of science facts and experiments, and cover everything from coding to chemistry.

You can learn about space exploration from National Geographic , earth science from AsapSCIENCE or computer programming from Jabrils Families with little ones can also join in on the fun and get their feet wet with STEM through YouTube Kids, too.

They can learn coding with Goldieblox , or complete fun and weird science activities with PBS KIDS We know this summer may be a bit different for a lot of us.

"What connects a baker in Bochum, two honest tour guides in Prague and make-up tutorials delivered through song from Milan? They’re all threads in Europe’s rich tapestry of YouTube creators.

And a new report from Oxford Economics shows the positive contribution they’re making to the continent’s culture, society and economy.

The research found that, in 2022, YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed over €5.5 billion to the EU27 GDP and supported more than 150,000 full-time equivalent jobs.

Behind these numbers are the stories of people across Europe, turning their passions and skills into a living by connecting with audiences on YouTube.

Many are turning this into real economic impact in their local communities.

Oxford Economics found that 76% of small and medium-sized businesses with a YouTube channel agree that the platform played a role in helping them grow their customer base by reaching new audiences.

Creators like Kiki Aweimer, who first developed her love for baking while helping out in her parent’s cafe.

In 2016, Kiki began to share easy to follow recipes, tips and tricks on YouTube, all filmed at home on her husband Hamza’s phone.

As her channel’s popularity grew, Kiki began earning revenue through the YouTube Partner Program, enabling her to invest in professional studio capabilities and hire people to help produce even more compelling baking content in a variety of formats.

Fast forward to today and Kikis Kitchen employs nearly 70 people across the channel, her online shop with branded merchandise, and a brick and mortar store and cafe in Bochum, Germany, where customers can try Kiki’s signature “San Sebastian Burnt Cheesecake” .

Kiki isn’t stopping there with plans to open stores in Düsseldorf and London.

European creators are also sharing their stories, building communities and shaping society.

Oxford Economics found that 70% of creators who earn money from YouTube agree that they identify and feel like they have a place to belong on YouTube.

Additionally, 84% of European viewers agree that with YouTube they can hear from diverse communities and/or cultures from around the world.

One example is Italian creator Loretta Grace, who believes that everyone, no matter their gender, age or skin tone, should be able to wear makeup, look their best and raise their self-esteem.

That’s why she started Grace On Your Dash after noticing a lack of make-up tutorials in Italian for people with dark skin tones.

Leaning into her experience as a singer and actor, Loretta brought a unique flair to her early videos, delivering tutorials and advice through song.

As she built her audience on YouTube, Loretta began sharing personal stories and featuring special guests doing each other’s make-up during the interview.

Today, Grace On Your Dash has over 650k subscribers and has become a powerful platform promoting inclusivity and representation in the beauty industry.

Reflecting on why her channel took off, Loretta says that there was no one else like her uploading this kind of content when she started, that people of colour in Italy had a strong desire to feel represented, and YouTube provided that platform.

European culture on the world’s screens Oxford Economics also found that 7 out of 10 European creators who earn money from YouTube agree that the platform helps them export their content to international audiences they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

And the viewing numbers bear out this cultural export story, with over 65% of watch time on content produced by channels in the EU coming from outside of the bloc.

This global audience of billions is learning about local European culture from creators like Janek Rubeš and Honza Mikulka, who started Honest Guide on YouTube to help tourists to navigate Prague like a local.

As you might expect, they post engaging, creative content on the best restaurants, cafes and handy transport routes, but they also steer visitors away from overpriced establishments and tourist scams.

In fact, the first video they uploaded spotlighted a currency exchange tourist trap to avoid.

With over 4.3m views, the video eventually helped prompt city officials to take action and shut down the scam.

Their open, honest guide to Prague has been so popular that Janek and Honza have been invited to give the Honest Guide treatment to Helsinki, Tallinn, Linz and Krakow for the benefit of their 1.3m subscribers.

The Oxford Economics research underlines that YouTube creators across Europe are having a real and positive impact on their communities, while creating jobs and enriching the lives of a global audience of billions.

Creators like Loretta, Kiki, Janek and Honza are the lifeblood of YouTube and we’re investing in making it the most rewarding place for them and thousands of other European creators.

It’s their stories that motivate me and my team every day as we work to make YouTube an even better place to share stories, build businesses, and find community.

It’s their stories that motivate me and my team every day as we work to make YouTube an even better place to share stories, build businesses, and find community.

"Over the past year at YouTube, we’ve increased our commitment and focus on social justice and equity.

Since the launch of YouTube 16 years ago, our platform has been a place where people come together, and we see this more than ever during difficult times.

In times of social unrest, YouTube is a place where people come to make their voices heard, find community, and advocate for change.

You may have seen some recent reporting about our ad placement process that suggests that YouTube prevents advertisers from running campaigns targeting social issues and movements like Black Lives Matter.

We want to make two things clear: Videos about topics like Black Lives Matter, Black culture, and Black excellence, can and do monetize on YouTube, along with topics related to a wide range of social justice issues.

We do not allow targeting of advertising against hateful terms.

Content that is hateful towards Black and other marginalized communities, including videos with themes of “white nationalism” or other offensive topics, are not eligible to monetize on YouTube.

And when we find this content on our platform, we remove it.

But while our policies are clear, our systems sometimes fall short, though we work quickly to correct them.

We want to clarify how our ad placement system works, and address the issue at the heart of these concerns, which is what kinds of content are able to earn revenue on YouTube.

This is how the ad placement tool works.

Advertisers enter words or phrases, the tool then suggests videos that could be related to the terms they search.

The tool has no impact on which content can or cannot monetize.

Reporters entered offensive terms to see which ones returned suggestions.

Though our system did block many hate terms, we failed to catch some others.

We regret that these terms were searchable in our ad placement tool and have corrected this gap.

But we want to be clear: this does not mean that the videos that surfaced were eligible to run advertising, or that advertisers can run campaigns connected to those offensive terms -- and in fact, neither of these things happened.

And much of the content that was suggested was news stories related to those issues, and not hateful content.

We’ve also had some questions about why terms that are not hateful or harmful were blocked in the ad placement tool.

Search terms may be blocked because we have detected the potential for abuse, such as creators seeking to run ads against another creator’s channel to showcase an opposing viewpoint.

At times, we may block terms, even temporarily, that seem counterintuitive, but it is done to protect our creators, our community, and promote user safety.

We will continue to take action to dismantle embedded racism on our platform.

We have hundreds of employees working on social justice efforts every day and we’re committed to tackling these issues over the long term.

A critical part of our commitment to social justice has been to ensure that creators can build thriving channels on our platform, earning revenue to sustain their businesses and their creativity.

Many advertisers have made public commitments to support diversity and racial equity.

Similarly, their customers come to YouTube to watch content on these topics and to hear from creators.

To help ensure that creators are able to earn the full value from their videos, we have been partnering with our advertisers and their agencies to help them expand their advertising campaigns on YouTube to reach wider and more diverse audiences, by reviewing their Brand Suitability settings such as their keyword exclusions.

We also have a dedicated Multicultural Strategy & Sales team whose remit is Advertiser Cultural Effectiveness, with a focus on increasing revenue opportunities for diverse creators and meeting inclusive advertising goals for advertisers via our premium CultureLab service, which delivers culture-first and privacy-first insights, inclusive creative best practices and inclusive media solutions.

Black creators and artists have and continue to play an important role in shaping the culture on YouTube, propelling our platform forward.

We are invested in these creators, artists, and their stories.

And we will continue to ensure that they can succeed on YouTube.",,,,In the news: Clarifying how we monetize social justice content,20210420,,,,en-en,youtube news,en,Global/Other,,,"Over the past year at YouTube, we’ve increased our commitment and focus on social justice and equity.

"We introduced Shorts to give creators a lightweight and fun way to create and share short-form videos on YouTube, and continue to expand on the ways that creators can easily tap into their creativity.

From remixing tools that help creators leverage content from across YouTube’s billions of videos worldwide in new, original content, to expanding the YouTube Partner Program so creators can join and earn money from their Shorts, we want to make it easier for anyone to join in and create what they love.

YouTube Shorts are now being watched by over 2B logged-in users every month, and today we’re introducing new ways to spark imagination and creativity.

Check out these 6 new ways to create on Shorts: 1.

A new way to remix with Collab Collab is a new creation tool that lets you record a Short in a side-by-side format with other YouTube or Shorts videos.

Creators can choose from multiple layout options to easily join in with a split screen format.

Just hit “Remix” then “Collab” to remix an eligible Short or YouTube video.

Collab joins Green Screen , which uses a YouTube video or Short as the background of our original Short, and Cut , which lets you use a 1-5 second segment from a YouTube video or Short in your own Short, as yet another way to remix Shorts content.

Starting today and in the coming weeks, we’ll roll out Collab to all creators on iOS, with Android to follow.

2.

Experiment with new effects and stickers Over the past few months, we’ve added dozens of new Shorts effects and stickers to help inspire creators in new ways.

And we’re always adding more – for instance, we’ll soon start rolling out a new Q&A sticker, so you can ask your audience questions and get responses right in your comments.

So next time you’re asking yourself, “What places do I need to visit in Japan?” our Q&A sticker has you covered.

Plus, with the ability to reply to comments with a Short , you can easily shout out whoever gave you the inspiration to create.

3.

Go live and get discovered on Shorts We’re excited to share that we’re now testing a mobile-first vertical live experience, so live creators can get discovered right in the Shorts feed! Viewers in the test will see previews of vertical live videos mixed into the Shorts feed.

As someone taps into the experience, they’ll be placed in a scrollable feed of other live videos.

We hope that this helps creators connect live with a new audience and build their communities in a modern and fun way, from wherever they are in the world.

Creators can go live in just a few taps - just make sure it’s vertical orientation! - and features like Super Chat, Super Stickers, and channel memberships will be available, too.

This is also a great opportunity for creators who recently joined our YouTube Partner Program with the new, lower eligibility requirements to unlock these fan funding features.

While nothing is changing to how creators go live today, we’re introducing this new, full-screen experience to viewers gradually, over the coming months.

That means that live creators will now have the opportunity to get discovered in more places! 4.

Streamline your creation with suggestions What better way to get inspired than by other Shorts creators? We’re making it easier to create on YouTube with Shorts whenever inspiration strikes on your feed with a new feature that bundles the audio and effect from the Short you’re remixing from automatically.

From the Shorts player, tap the Remix button and select “use sound.” We’ll automatically surface the same audio time stamp from the Short you just watched, and the same effect as a creation suggestion.

You can always mix and match to make it your own, too! 5.

Save Shorts to playlists to find inspiration We recently introduced the option to save Shorts to playlists right on YouTube, so anybody can curate Shorts they love to a playlist directly from the Shorts feed.

Creators, if you don’t want to lose the effect you just discovered, pop it into a playlist so you can pull it up and try it yourself when inspiration strikes next! To see Shorts playlists in action, check out this curated playlist from JVKE.

6.

An easier way to transform your videos to Shorts In the next few weeks, we’ll start to test new recomposition tools that will help you more easily transform your horizontal videos into Shorts! Once you choose a video to remix, you’ll be able to adjust the layout, zoom, and crop of the video segment.

Split screen effects will also be available, so you can preserve key parts of your long-form content to create more engaging, original Shorts.

We’ll share more in the coming weeks as we roll these new tools out.

There’s so much more to come with Shorts, so stay tuned as we introduce more features in the future!

"Viewers across the United States came to YouTube this past midterms to learn and engage in a variety of ways.

They heard directly from candidates, dug into campaign issues, and stayed informed on the latest news and election results.

At YouTube, our overriding goal was critical: to connect people to high-quality news and information.

Now that the Georgia runoff has wrapped up, we’re giving insight into how we delivered on this critical, foundational goal.

Helping voters access authoritative news and information During major news moments, YouTube shows content from trusted sources for viewers in prominent news shelves, and the midterms were no exception.

In the month of November alone, our Breaking News and Top News shelves surfaced more than 65 million times on the YouTube homepage and at the top of search results in multiple languages, including English and Spanish.

And that’s just one touchpoint.

The recommendations we serve to viewers offer up another potent opportunity to raise up quality content.

Leading up to and following election day, our recommendation system prominently recommended content from trusted national and local news sources across multiple languages, including English and Spanish.

Over 85% of recommendations on midterms-related topics came from authoritative news sources, such as Univision and NBC News.

And we found that when people searched for news and information about the midterms, on average, more than 85% of the videos in search results came from quality news sources, such as CNN en Español and The Wall Street Journal.

The remaining content covered topics like entertainment and finance.

We also displayed key information panels from trusted sources underneath videos and in search results about the midterms.

Available in both English and Spanish, viewers were shown additional context relevant to elections content — from more on how to vote ahead of the election to an election results panel that began surfacing on election day.

In total, our election-related information panels and reminders have been shown over 2 billion times, over 100 million of which were in Spanish.

Removing violative content before it’s widely viewed Over the years, our Trust and Safety teams have worked across policies and technology to create systems that uphold election integrity.

On top of raising up quality information, that means removing election content that violates our Community Guidelines.

This includes videos misleading voters on how to vote, encouraging interference in the democratic process, inciting violence (including against election workers), or advancing certain types of elections misinformation — like claiming that the 2020 U.S.

presidential election was stolen or rigged.

We’ve removed over 10,000 videos related to the midterms for violating our Community Guidelines, including those that violated our election integrity policy.

75% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views.

And we enforced our policies regardless of a speaker’s public figure status or their political viewpoint, and regardless of the language the content was in.

At YouTube, we’re constantly working to make sure we can be a reliable source for timely news and information.

"YouTube is a place where teens can learn, explore their passions, express themselves, and find belonging.

We recognize the important part we play in their lives and today, we’re introducing a new supervised experience on YouTube that will give parents and teens the option to link their accounts and get shared insights and notifications.

This new experience is designed to keep parents informed about their teens' channel activity on YouTube and help them provide encouragement and advice on responsible content creation.

Beginning to roll out to families globally this week, the first iteration of this experience builds on our existing supervised experience for pre-teens.

Soon, parents and teens will be able to link their YouTube accounts in our new Family Center hub.

In Family Center, parents can see shared insights into their teens’ channel activity on YouTube including the number of uploads, subscriptions and comments.

Parents (and teens) will also receive proactive email notifications at key events, like when teens upload a video or start a livestream, providing an opportunity to offer advice on responsible creation supported by resources created with Common Sense Networks, an affiliate of Common Sense Media.

Our products for youth, YouTube Kids and supervised experiences for pre-teens, reach more than 100 million active logged-in and logged-out viewers every month and the development of these products is guided by independent experts in child development, digital learning, and children’s media who hail from academic, nonprofit, and clinical backgrounds.

In partnership with these experts and in accordance with our youth principles , we’ve created this new experience that respects teens’ autonomy by giving parents and teens mutual control and new resources that empower teens to become informed and responsible digital citizens.

We'll continue engaging with experts and parents as we expand and evolve this experience.

“It's so important for teens to have space to make their own choices, express themselves, and explore their identity and values.

It's also important to have the wisdom of trusted adults in their lives if they need them.

That's why when I talk with teens and their parents about online activities, I encourage the idea of 'trust, but verify.' YouTube’s supervised experience for teens holds these developmental principles by having teens and their parents share decisions about supervision with continued open, two-way communication.” - Ellen Selkie, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison Over the years, we’ve invested in a range of features to protect our younger users, from combating the promotion of eating disorders and suicide to introducing new privacy and wellbeing protections .

"Today, we’re introducing a new feature that gives you access to YouTube TV from within the YouTube app, making it easier to enjoy all the content you love.

Existing members can easily access YouTube TV by clicking on “Go to YouTube TV” in the main YouTube app.

This update will be available to all YouTube TV members on Roku over the next few days, and we will expand to as many devices as we can over time.

While we roll out this new feature we also want to give you an update on where things stand in our negotiations with Roku as we know that's on many of our members' minds.

We’re still working to come to an agreement with Roku to ensure continued access to YouTube TV for our mutual customers.

As of right now, existing YouTube TV members still have access to the app on Roku devices.

We’re also in discussions with other partners to secure free streaming devices in case YouTube TV members face any access issues on Roku.

Separately, we are also in ongoing, long-term conversations with Roku to certify that new devices meet our technical requirements.

This certification process exists to ensure a consistent and high-quality YouTube experience across different devices, including Google’s own--so you know how to navigate the app and what to expect.

We'll continue our conversations with Roku on certification, in good faith, with the goal of advocating for our mutual customers.

"For the latest on how to use Messenger Kids, visit ourHelp Center.
WelaunchedMessenger Kids in 2017 after meeting with thousands of parents, parenting organizations, child safety advocates and child development experts about the need for a messaging app that lets kids have fun connecting with friends and family while giving parents control over the experience. With two out of three parents wishing they had more control over their kids’ online experiences,* we’ve continued our dialogue with parents and experts around the world to ensure we’re providing a messaging app that works for families. Today, we’re announcing additional tools and features for parents to manage their child’s experience in Messenger Kids, and updating our privacy policy.
Parents can access these new features in the Messenger Kids Parent Dashboard in the Facebook iOS and Android apps to better understand how their child is using the app.
“Facebook has done a good job of balancing features that both deliver the right information to keep parents in the loop about their child’s use of Messenger Kids, while also allowing children to have fun and learn digital literacy skills. It’s important to give parents the power to manage their child’s experience, like seeing what images and videos their children are sending and receiving. It’s great to see Facebook providing additional information without overwhelming parents with too much detail.”– Larry Magid, Internet safety advocate and CEO of ConnectSafely.org(ConnectSafely is a nonprofit internet safety organization that receives support from Facebook and other tech companies. ConnectSafely also serves as a member of Facebook’sSafety Advisory Board, and receives an honorarium in appreciation of their time and expertise.)(Updated on February 4, 2020 at 9:48am PT to clarify organization’s role.)
New Parent Dashboard features include:

You can access the Parent Dashboard and all these new features by tapping the shortcut menu in the Facebook app and scrolling to the Messenger Kids icon. If you have multiple kids using Messenger Kids, select the name of the child whose account you’d like to manage to access their specific dashboard.
A New Way to Block
We’ve updated the way kids block contacts in Messenger Kids to give them a simpler way to manage who they interact with. Kids can now unblock a blocked contact on their own if they want to restart one-on-one chats with them, and chats with blocked contacts will stay in the Messenger Kids inbox so parents can view them if they’d like. Kids and their blocked contacts will remain visible to one another and will stay in shared group chats, but will not be able to message each other individually. Kids will also receive a warning if they return to, or are added to, a group chat that includes a blocked contact, and can leave group chats at any time.
Parents remain in control of who their child is connected to in Messenger Kids and can remove people from their child’s contact list at any time. To get more information on how blocking works in Messenger Kids, visit theHelp Center.
Helping Kids Understand How Their Information Is Used
As kids start using technology, we think it’s important to help them understand how their information is used and shared. That’s why we developed an in-app activity that uses kid-appropriate language to educate kids on the types of information people can see about them. For example, we inform kids that people they know may see their name and photo, that parents can see and download their messaging content and that they are not able to delete any messages they send or receive.
Like any app, Messenger Kids requires data to operate basic functions, such as to show previous messages in a conversation, put frequent contacts at the top of the contact list and show the devices used to log in to a child’s Messenger Kids account.


Privacy Policy Update
When families choose Messenger Kids, parents trust us to protect their children’s data and privacy, and we take that responsibility seriously. We’ve updated the Messenger Kids privacy policy to include additional information about our data collection, use, sharing, retention and deletion practices.
The updated policy explains our privacy practices with regard to the new features and improvements we’ve added to Messenger Kids, such as new controls and visibility in the Parent Dashboard.
In addition to the new features we’re announcing today, the updated privacy policy describes some things we expect to roll out later. For example, we plan to enableMessenger Kids users to provide feedback directly in the app when something isn’t working and run user surveys to help improve product features.Parents have also told us they want more options when they determine theirchild is ready for more control and responsibility, so the updated policy describes some forthcoming options for parents on how their child can use the app. We will continue to consult with parents and experts, and we’ll share more about those features when they launch.
There are a number of things that aren’t changing with the new features and updated privacy policy. For example, we haven’t changed our practices with regard to sharing information with third parties. Theprivacy policycontinues to make it clear – now with even greater transparency – that we share information with service providers for the purpose of operating the Messenger Kids service. We require them to adhere tostrict data confidentiality and security obligations, and work with themon things like reviewing and addressing reported issues from our users.(Updated on December 2, 2021 at 5:00PM PT to reflect specific language in the Messenger Kids Privacy Policy.)
We don’t use children’s data from Messenger Kids for advertising. There continue to be no ads in Messenger Kids and no in-app purchases. And as the updated privacy policy reaffirms,we don’t sell any of your or your child’s information to anyone, and we never will.
These updates are part of our ongoing efforts to provide more transparency and help people better understand how our services work. Parents will have 90 days to review and accept the new privacy policy and we strongly encourage them to review the updates with their kids. The updated privacy policy can be foundhere.

"Starting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated ourPrivacy Policy, formerly known as the Data Policy. Inspired by feedback from people who use our technologies and privacy experts, we rewrote our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand and to reflect the latest products we offer. While the text looks different in many places,Meta is not collecting, using or sharing your data in new ways based on this policy update andwe still do not sell your information.
Our goal with this update is to be more clear about our data practices; one way we’ve done this is through additional details and examples throughout. At Meta, we’ve always set out to build personalized experiences that provide value without compromising your privacy. So, it’s on us to have strong protections for the data we use and be transparent about how we use it. That includescommunicating more clearlyabout our data practices and the choices you have.
We’re also including more ways to access controls you can use to experience our products in ways that are right for you. You can continue to manage your privacy settings at any time andwe’re committed to letting you know if we make important changes to how we collect, use and share your information.
In addition, we’re updating ourTerms of Servicetobetter explain what is expected from us and those who use our platforms. These expectations include the rights and obligations described in our Community Standards, for example when we may disable or terminate accounts that violate our Terms or Community Standards or others’ intellectual property rights or other laws. Some Terms of Service changes match updates to our Privacy Policy, including additional details about what happens when you delete content.
Notifications that people will start to receive today on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger will direct them to information about what to expect from the relevant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in their region. They’ll also see a summary of what’s different. These updates go into effect on July 26, and people don’t need to act on this notification by this date to continue using our products.
The updated Meta Privacy Policy covers Facebook, Instagram, Messenger andother Meta products. It doesn’t cover WhatsApp, Workplace, Free Basics, Messenger Kids or the use of Quest devices without a Facebook account, which have their own privacy policies.

As privacy and data protection regulations have improved around the world in recent years, we’veexploredideas in people-centered privacy design and have worked to make our data practices more transparent. The updates we’re announcing today are inspired by feedback from privacy experts, policymakers, and people who use our services. Our aim going forward is to update our Privacy Policy more frequently as we continue to learn what areas we can improve.
We encourage everyone to read our updated Policy which will help people understand how our practices apply, including up to date information about our newer products, like Shops and Facebook View, as we continue to innovate. We’ve added more examples about the kinds of information we collect to provide the personalized services people expect, like recommended content and suggested connections. We’ve also included more details about the types of third-parties with whom we share and receive information and explained how and why people’s information is shared across our products, among other changes. Our updated policy has more details about information we collect if you use our products but don’t have an account and when we share information with law enforcement for the purposes of safety and security. For a summary of other key changes to our Privacy Policy, you can reviewthis page.

Earlier this year, we began to roll outPrivacy Centeras a place where people can learn more about Meta’s approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now available to everyone who uses Facebook on desktop and mobile and connects directly to our updated Privacy Policy.
You can think of Privacy Center as a hub for your privacy questions, where you can learn about how we use data, make use of some of the various privacy controls that we offer, and brush up on key account security tips and tools. We’ll also continue adding more guides and controls to it.
New Audience Controls:Starting today, we’re also rolling out a new setting to make it easier to manage who sees your posts on Facebook. Now, when someone selects a default audience, that audience selection will apply to new posts created in Facebook that they share to their timeline unless they select a different audience for a particular post. Previously, your default audience for posts matched whichever audience you chose most recently. So if you had just made a post that was available to the public, your subsequent posts would be as well. Thisnew settingwill help make sure you’re sharing with the right people in your community.
New Ways to Manage the Ads You See:Recently, we consolidated the Ad Topics and Interest Categories controls into a single control that can be accessed on Facebook and Instagram, covering a more extensive set of ad topics.This allows peopleto use a single control to set preferences across ad topics that reflect the interest targeting categories advertisers may use to reach them and the content they might see in an ad.",,,,Here’s What You Need to Know About Our Updated Privacy Policy and Terms of Service,"May 26, 2022",,"May 26, 2022",,en-en,"Privacy Matters, Data and Privacy, Public Policy",en,English,,,"Starting today, Meta is rolling out notifications letting people know that we’ve updated ourPrivacy Policy, formerly known as the Data Policy.

"Last week, weshared more detailsabout a public database containing information about people on Facebook that appeared online and generated a lot of conversation around data scraping. Given the fact that similar stories have emerged since then about public datasets involving information obtained from a number of other companies, includingLinkedInand Clubhouse, we’d like to explain more about what scraping is, how it works and what we’re doing to prevent scraping to protect people’s information.
Scraping is the automated collection of data from a website or app and can be both authorized and unauthorized. Every time you use a search engine, for example, you are likely using data which was scraped in automated ways with the consent of the website or app. This is a form of scraping known as crawling and it’s what helps make the internet searchable.
Using automation to get data from Facebook without our permission is a violation of our terms. The data itself is not necessarily off-limits; scraped data is often widely available for ordinary people to access in their everyday use of the website or app. Scrapers may not access or collect data from our products using automated means without our prior permission.
Scrapers commonly try to blend in with others and can hide what they’re doing by mimicking the ways people would normally use a product. As a result, it can be difficult to detect them. We do however, have a number of methods to distinguish unauthorized, automated activity from legitimate usage, which we explain below.
We devote substantial resources to combating unauthorized scraping on Facebook products. We have a dedicated External Data Misuse (EDM) team made up of more than 100 people, including data scientists, analysts and engineers focused on our efforts to detect, block and deter scraping.
Because scrapers mimic the ways that people use our products legitimately, we will never be able to fully prevent all scraping without harming people’s ability to use our apps and websites the way they enjoy. That means that we have to try to strike the right balance and rely on a variety of approaches to address scraping. Since scraping is both a common and complex challenge to solve, we take a more holistic approach to staying ahead of it. In short, we aim to make it harder for scrapers to acquire data from our services in the first place and harder to capitalize off of it if they do.
The first way we aim to make scraping more difficult is through the use of rate limits and data limits. Rate limits cap the number of times anyone can interact with our products in a given amount of time, while data limits keep people from getting more data than they should need to use our products normally.
Limits are only a first layer of protection, and we know that scrapers are determined to find new ways to get data. That’s why we’ve also focused on developing other methods of identifying and deterring scraping. We won’t go into all of them because we don’t want to give a roadmap to scrapers seeking to evade our defenses, but one example is that we look for patterns in activity and behavior that are typically associated with automated computer activity and stop it.
Our EDM team also investigates suspected scrapers to learn more about what they’re doing and make our systems stronger. We’ve taken a variety of actions against data misuse. These can include sendingcease and desistletters,disabling accounts,filing lawsuitsagainst scrapers engaging in egregious behavior and requesting companies that host scraped data to take them down. This is also why it’s important for governments to do more to investigate and take action against unlawful scraping activity.
Scrapers who improperly collect data from Facebook sometimes make this data available in online forums such as the one that was reported on last week. The EDM team tries to keep that data from being shared online by engaging with threat intelligence researchers to look for examples of these datasets being shared and work with responsible hosting vendors to get them taken offline.
In addition to the steps we take to protect your data, we also want to empower the people who use our services to make it harder for their information to be misused. That’s why our existing user privacy controls allow people to adjust their settings for things like what information of theirs is public or who can look them up by their phone number. We also recently launched adedicated pagein ourHelp Centerto inform people about scraping and what they can do to protect their information. For example, our Privacy Checkup feature helps walk people through their privacy and security settings, including Who Can See What You Share and How People Can Find You on Facebook. We recommend people review their privacy settings regularly to ensure they align with their current preferences. In addition, ourPrivacy Matters pageprovides more insight into our privacy initiatives, and we plan to publish more about our approach to scraping and what we find.",,,,How We Combat Scraping,"April 15, 2021",,"April 15, 2021",,en-en,"Privacy Matters, Data and Privacy, Integrity and Security",en,English,,,"Last week, weshared more detailsabout a public database containing information about people on Facebook that appeared online and generated a lot of conversation around data scraping.

Because scrapers mimic the ways that people use our products legitimately, we will never be able to fully prevent all scraping without harming people’s ability to use our apps and websites the way they enjoy. That means that we have to try to strike the right balance and rely on a variety of approaches to address scraping. Since scraping is both a common and complex challenge to solve, we take a more holistic approach to staying ahead of it. In short, we aim to make it harder for scrapers to acquire data from our services in the first place and harder to capitalize off of it if they do.
The first way we aim to make scraping more difficult is through the use of rate limits and data limits. Rate limits cap the number of times anyone can interact with our products in a given amount of time, while data limits keep people from getting more data than they should need to use our products normally.
Limits are only a first layer of protection, and we know that scrapers are determined to find new ways to get data. That’s why we’ve also focused on developing other methods of identifying and deterring scraping. We won’t go into all of them because we don’t want to give a roadmap to scrapers seeking to evade our defenses, but one example is that we look for patterns in activity and behavior that are typically associated with automated computer activity and stop it.
Our EDM team also investigates suspected scrapers to learn more about what they’re doing and make our systems stronger. We’ve taken a variety of actions against data misuse. These can include sendingcease and desistletters,disabling accounts,filing lawsuitsagainst scrapers engaging in egregious behavior and requesting companies that host scraped data to take them down. This is also why it’s important for governments to do more to investigate and take action against unlawful scraping activity.
Scrapers who improperly collect data from Facebook sometimes make this data available in online forums such as the one that was reported on last week. The EDM team tries to keep that data from being shared online by engaging with threat intelligence researchers to look for examples of these datasets being shared and work with responsible hosting vendors to get them taken offline.
In addition to the steps we take to protect your data, we also want to empower the people who use our services to make it harder for their information to be misused. That’s why our existing user privacy controls allow people to adjust their settings for things like what information of theirs is public or who can look them up by their phone number. We also recently launched adedicated pagein ourHelp Centerto inform people about scraping and what they can do to protect their information. For example, our Privacy Checkup feature helps walk people through their privacy and security settings, including Who Can See What You Share and How People Can Find You on Facebook. We recommend people review their privacy settings regularly to ensure they align with their current preferences. In addition, ourPrivacy Matters pageprovides more insight into our privacy initiatives, and we plan to publish more about our approach to scraping and what we find.",How We Combat Scraping,safety_tag,Meta,,Mike Clark,https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/how-we-combat-scraping/,,,Product Management Director,meta,28,m-meta-28,Yes,2021-04-15,,This news release contains both [recent/upcoming] and [old] changes (will include only recent/upcoming changes in analysis),3,"Yes, author info in the metadata is correct",,,,"The first way we aim to make scraping more difficult is through the use of rate limits and data limits.

"This piece originally ran inAdAge.
When society is divided and tensions run high, those divisions play out on social media. Platforms like Facebook hold up a mirror to society — with more than 3 billion people using Facebook’s apps every month, everything that is good, bad and ugly in our societies will find expression on our platform. That puts a big responsibility on Facebook and other social media companies to decide where to draw the line over what content is acceptable.
Facebook has come in for much criticism in recent weeks following its decision to allow controversial posts by President Trump to stay up, and misgivings on the part of many people, including companies that advertise on our platform, about our approach to tackling hate speech. I want to be unambiguous: Facebook does not profit from hate. Billions of people use Facebook and Instagram because they have good experiences — they don’t want to see hateful content, our advertisers don’t want to see it, and we don’t want to see it. There is no incentive for us to do anything but remove it.
More than 100 billion messages are sent on our services every day. That’s all of us, talking to each other, sharing our lives, our opinions, our hopes and our experiences. In all of those billions of interactions a tiny fraction are hateful. When we find hateful posts on Facebook and Instagram, we take a zero tolerance approach and remove them. When content falls short of being classified as hate speech — or of our other policies aimed at preventing harm or voter suppression — we err on the side of free expression because, ultimately, the best way to counter hurtful, divisive, offensive speech, is more speech. Exposing it to sunlight is better than hiding it in the shadows.
Unfortunately, zero tolerance doesn’t mean zero incidences. With so much content posted every day, rooting out the hate is like looking for a needle in a haystack. We invest billions of dollars each year in people and technology to keep our platform safe. We have tripled — to more than 35,000 — the people working on safety and security. We’re a pioneer in artificial intelligence technology to remove hateful content at scale.
And we’re making real progress. A recent European Commission report found that Facebook assessed 95.7% of hate speech reports in less than 24 hours, faster than YouTube and Twitter. Last month, we reported that we find nearly 90% of the hate speech we remove before someone reports it — up from 24% little over two years ago. We took action against 9.6 million pieces of content in the first quarter of 2020 — up from 5.7 million in the previous quarter. And 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda content we remove is taken down before anyone reports it to us.
We are getting better — but we’re not complacent. That’s why we recently announced new policies and products to make sure everyone can stay safe, stay informed, and ultimately use their voice where it matters most — voting. We understand that many of our critics are angry about the inflammatory rhetoric President Trump has posted on our platform and others, and want us to be more aggressive in removing his speech. As a former politician myself, I know that the only way to hold the powerful to account is ultimately through the ballot box. That is why we want to use our platform to empower voters to make the ultimate decision themselves, on election day. This Friday every Facebook user of voting age in the US will be given information, prominently displayed on the top of their News Feed, on how to register to vote. This will be one step in the largest voter information campaign in US history, with a goal of registering 4 million voters. We have also been updating our policies to crack down on voter suppression. Many of these changes are a direct result of feedback from the civil rights community — we’ll keep working with them and other experts as we adjust our policies to address new risks as they emerge.
Of course, focusing on hate speech and other types of harmful content on social media is necessary and understandable, but it is worth remembering that the vast majority of those billions of conversations are positive.
Look at what happened when the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Billions of people used Facebook to stay connected when they were physically apart. Grandparents and grandchildren, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors. And more than that, people came together to help each other. Thousands and thousands of local groups formed — millions of people came together — in order to organize to help the most vulnerable in their communities. Others, to celebrate and support our healthcare workers. And when businesses had to close their doors to the public, for many Facebook was their lifeline. More than 160 million businesses use Facebook’s free tools to reach customers, and many used these tools to help them keep their businesses afloat when their doors were closed to the public — saving people’s jobs and livelihoods.
Importantly, Facebook helped people to get accurate, authoritative health information. We directed more than 2 billion people on Facebook and Instagram to information from the World Health Organization and other public health authorities, with more than 350 million people clicking through.
And it is worth remembering that when the darkest things are happening in our society, social media gives people a means to shine a light. To show the world what is happening, to organize against hate and come together, and for millions of people around the world to show their solidarity. We’ve seen that all over the world on countless occasions — and we are seeing it right now with the Black Lives Matter movement.
We may never be able to prevent hate from appearing on Facebook entirely, but we are getting better at stopping it all the time.",,,,Facebook Does Not Benefit from Hate,"July 1, 2020",,"December 22, 2021",,en-en,"Civil Rights, Combating Hate Speech, Community Standards and Enforcement, Safety and Expression",en,English,,,"This piece originally ran inAdAge.

"Over the past year, we have repeatedly taken action against violent actors and bad content on Facebook in Myanmar. The ethnic violence happening in Myanmar is horrific and we don’t want our services to be used to spread hate, incite violence or fuel tension on the ground.
Our approach to this problem, like the problem itself, is multifaceted, but our purpose is clear: to reduce the likelihood that Facebook will be used to facilitate offline harm. Our tactics include identifying and removing fake accounts; finding and removing violent actors; building better tools and technology that allows us to proactively find bad content; evolving our policies; and continuing to build partnerships and programs on the ground. We have shared regular updates on this work. Since last August, we’vetaken downthree networks who were misrepresenting who they were and what they were doing,banned Myanmar military officials, given anupdateon the steps we’re taking to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation and released the findings of theHuman Rights Impact Assessmenton the role of our services in the country.
Today, we are taking more action, designating four more groups in Myanmar as dangerous organizations – the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Kachin Independence Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. These armed groups are nowbanned from Facebookand all related praise, support and representation will be removed as soon as we become aware of it.
In an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or engage in violence to have a presence on Facebook. Thisincludes terrorist activity, organized hate, mass or serial murder, human trafficking, organized violence or criminal activity. There is clear evidence that these organizations have been responsible for attacks against civilians and have engaged in violence in Myanmar, and we want to prevent them from using our services to further inflame tensions on the ground.

That’s why we are always evaluating and analyzing our policies around violence committed by state and non-state actors.

"Today, we filed a federal lawsuit in California court to disrupt phishing attacks designed to deceive people into sharing their login credentials on fake login pages for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Phishing is a significant threat to millions of Internet users. Phishing attacks lure victims to a website that appears to be operated by a trusted entity, such as a bank, a merchant, or other service. The website, however, is a deception, a fake, and the site’s fake content is designed to persuade a victim to enter sensitive information, like a password or email address. Reports of phishing attacks have been on the rise across the industry and we are taking this action to uncover the identities of the people behind the attack and stop their harmful conduct.
This phishing scheme involved the creation of more than 39,000 websites impersonating the login pages of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. On these websites, people were prompted to enter their usernames and passwords, which Defendants collected.
As part of the attacks, Defendants used a relay service to redirect internet traffic to the phishing websites in a way that obscured their attack infrastructure. This enabled them to conceal the true location of the phishing websites, and the identities of their online hosting providers and the defendants. Starting in March 2021, when the volume of these attacks increased, we worked with the relay service to suspend thousands of URLs to the phishing websites.
This lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people’s safety and privacy, send a clear message to those trying to abuse our platform, and increase accountability of those who abuse technology. We will also continue to collaborate with online hosting and service providers to identify and disrupt phishing attacks as they occur. We proactively block and report instances of abuse to the hosting and security community, domain name registrars, privacy/proxy services, and others. And Meta blocks and shares phishing URLs so other platforms can also block them.",,,,Taking Legal Action Against Phishing Attacks,"December 20, 2021",,"December 20, 2021",,en-en,"Legal Action, Data and Privacy, Integrity and Security, Public Policy",en,English,,,"Today, we filed a federal lawsuit in California court to disrupt phishing attacks designed to deceive people into sharing their login credentials on fake login pages for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Phishing is a significant threat to millions of Internet users.

The website, however, is a deception, a fake, and the site’s fake content is designed to persuade a victim to enter sensitive information, like a password or email address. Reports of phishing attacks have been on the rise across the industry and we are taking this action to uncover the identities of the people behind the attack and stop their harmful conduct.
This phishing scheme involved the creation of more than 39,000 websites impersonating the login pages of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. On these websites, people were prompted to enter their usernames and passwords, which Defendants collected.
As part of the attacks, Defendants used a relay service to redirect internet traffic to the phishing websites in a way that obscured their attack infrastructure. This enabled them to conceal the true location of the phishing websites, and the identities of their online hosting providers and the defendants. Starting in March 2021, when the volume of these attacks increased, we worked with the relay service to suspend thousands of URLs to the phishing websites.
This lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people’s safety and privacy, send a clear message to those trying to abuse our platform, and increase accountability of those who abuse technology. We will also continue to collaborate with online hosting and service providers to identify and disrupt phishing attacks as they occur. We proactively block and report instances of abuse to the hosting and security community, domain name registrars, privacy/proxy services, and others.

"Today, we’re introducing new ways to support people on Instagram who may be affected by negative body image or an eating disorder, including surfacing more expert-backed resources when people search for eating disorder-related content, expanding our work with experts to help inform our policies, and collaborating with community leaders to help them create and share positive, inspiring body image content.
While we don’t allow content that promotes or encourages self-harm and eating disorders, we do allow people toshare their own experiences and journeysaround self-image and body acceptance. We know that these stories can prompt important conversations and provide community support, but can also be triggering for some. To address this, when someone tries to search for or share self-harm related content, we currently blur potentially triggering images and point people to helpful resources. However, we’ve heard from experts that we would support people more if we made available dedicated resources to cope with eating disorders or body dissatisfaction, which is why we are introducing new resources specific to body image issues.
These new resources will include contacts for local eating disorders hotlines in certain countries, such asBeatin the UK,National Eating Disorder Information Centrein Canada andButterfly Foundationin Australia, as well as new advice on how to build body confidence that we built in partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) in the US. As experts tell us that intervening early can be helpful, if someone tries searching for terms related to disordered eating, we’ll share these resources first before showing the search results. These resources will also be surfaced if someone tries sharing this content, or if a friend is concerned about something they see posted and wants to offer support. In the coming weeks, we’ll also make it easier to connect with friends in the moment by adding the ability to message on Instagram directly from the resources.

We don’t want anyone on Instagram to feel marginalized, particularly people with eating disorders or body image issues. While we already work in partnership with experts to understand how to support those affected by eating disorders, there’s always more we can learn. That’s why we’re hosting feedback sessions with community leaders and experts globally to learn more about emerging issues in the eating disorders space, and new approaches for offering support.
We’re also working with NEDA to share programming during National Eating Disorders Awareness Week in the US for the third year in a row. Throughout the week, community leaders like@mikzazon,@jamesissmilingand@kendramorouswill be sharing Reels to encourage positive body image, push back against weight stigma and harmful stereotypes, and show that all bodies are worthy and deserve to be celebrated.

"Over the past two decades, Facebook has empowered people around the world with a wealth of social and economic benefits. It has made social connection and free expression possible on a massive scale. This can be especially important for people who are in places that are experiencing conflict and violence.
Facebook supports people’s right to express themselves freely, regardless of where they are in the world. Freedom of expression is a foundational human right and enables many other rights.  But we know that technologies for free expression, information and opinion can also be abused to spread hate and misinformation — a challenge made even worse in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. This requires developing both short-term solutions that we can implement when crises arise and having a long-term strategy to keep people safe. Here is our approach.
Since 2018, we’ve haddedicated teams spanning product, engineering, policy, research and operations to better understand and address the way social media is used in countries experiencing conflict.Many of these individuals have experience working on conflict, human rights and humanitarian issues, as well as addressing areas like misinformation, hate speech and polarization. Many have lived or worked in the countries we’ve identified as highest risk and speak relevant languages. They are part of the over 40,000 people we have working on safety and security, including global content review teams in over 20 sites around the world reviewing content in over 70 languages.
In the last two years, we’ve hired more people with language, country and topic expertise. For example, we’ve increased the number of team members with work experience in Myanmar and Ethiopia to include former humanitarian aid workers, crisis responders and policy specialists. And we’ve hired more people who can review content in Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali and Burmese. Adding more language expertise has been a key focus area for us. This year alone, we’ve hired content moderators in 12 new languages, including Haitian Creole, Kirundi, Tswana and Kinyarwanda.
Our teams have developed an industry-leading process for reviewing and prioritizing which countries have the highest risk of offline harm and violence every six months. We make these determinations in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and following a review of these factors:
Using this prioritization process, wedevelop longer-term strategies to prepare for, respond to and mitigate the impacts of harmful offline events in the countries we deem most at risk.This allows us to act quickly to remove content that violates our policies and take other protective measures while still protecting freedom of expression and other human rights principles. Recent examples include our preparations forelections inMyanmar,Ethiopia,Indiaand Mexico.
In a crisis, we will determine what kind of support and teams we need to dedicate to a particular country or language, and for how long we need to keep them in place. This might include deploying our Integrity Product Operations Centers model to monitor and respond to threats in real time. It can also include seeking to ensure our integrity systems and resources are robust and ready where there may be ongoing risk of political unrest, or building temporary product levers ahead of a protest or a culturally sensitive event — all while ensuring that we have teams ready to support unplanned events, suchresponding to thecoupin Myanmar.
We know that we face a number of challenges with this work and it is a complex and often adversarial space — there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Many of these offline issues have existed for decades or longer, and media services have a long history of being abused by those seeking to assert or maintain power or incite violence. But, we know our work to keep our global community safe will never be finished and it requires ongoing vigilance and investments.

"Financial sextortionis a horrific crime. We’ve spent years working closely with experts, including those experienced in fighting these crimes, to understand the tactics scammers use to find and extort victims online, so we can develop effective ways to help stop them.
Today, we’re sharing an overview of our latest work to tackle these crimes. This includes new tools we’re testing to help protect people from sextortion and other forms of intimate image abuse, and to make it as hard as possible for scammers to find potential targets – on Meta’s apps and across the internet. We’re also testing new measures to support young people in recognizing and protecting themselves from sextortion scams.
These updates build on our longstanding work to help protect young people from unwanted or potentially harmful contact. Wedefault teens into stricter message settingsso they can’t be messaged by anyone they’re not already connected to, showSafety Noticesto teens who are already in contact with potential scam accounts, and offer a dedicated option for people to report DMs that are threatening to share private images. We alsosupportedthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in developingTake It Down, a platform that lets young people take back control of their intimate images and helps prevent them being shared online – taking power away from scammers.
While people overwhelmingly use DMs to share what they love with their friends, family or favorite creators, sextortion scammers may also use private messages to share or ask for intimate images. To help address this, we’ll soon start testing our new nudity protection feature in Instagram DMs, which blurs images detected as containing nudity and encourages people to think twice before sending nude images. This feature is designed not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude images to trick people into sending their own images in return.
Nudity protection will be turned on by default for teens under 18 globally, and we’ll show a notification to adults encouraging them to turn it on.
When nudity protection is turned on, people sending images containing nudity will see a message reminding them to be cautious when sending sensitive photos, and that they can unsend these photos if they’ve changed their mind.

Anyone who tries to forward a nude image they’ve received will see a message encouraging them to reconsider.

When someone receives an image containing nudity, it will be automatically blurred under a warning screen, meaning the recipient isn’t confronted with a nude image and they can choose whether or not to view it. We’ll also show them a message encouraging them not to feel pressure to respond, with an option to block the sender and report the chat.

When sending or receiving these images, people will be directed to safety tips, developed with guidance from experts, about the potential risks involved. These tips include reminders that people may screenshot or forward images without your knowledge, that your relationship to the person may change in the future, and that you should review profiles carefully in case they’re not who they say they are. They also link to a range of resources, includingMeta’s Safety Center,support helplines,StopNCII.orgfor those over 18, andTake It Downfor those under 18.

Nudity protection uses on-device machine learning to analyze whether an image sent in a DM on Instagram contains nudity. Because the images are analyzed on the device itself, nudity protection will work in end-to-end encrypted chats, where Meta won’t have access to these images – unless someone chooses to report them to us.
“Companies have a responsibility to ensure the protection of minors who use their platforms. Meta’s proposed device-side safety measures within its encrypted environment is encouraging. We are hopeful these new measures will increase reporting by minors and curb the circulation of online child exploitation.”–John Shehan, Senior Vice President, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
“As an educator, parent, and researcher on adolescent online behavior, I applaud Meta’s new feature that handles the exchange of personal nude content in a thoughtful, nuanced, and appropriate way. It reduces unwanted exposure to potentially traumatic images, gently introduces cognitive dissonance to those who may be open to sharing nudes, and educates people about the potential downsides involved. Each of these should help decrease the incidence of sextortion and related harms, helping to keep young people safe online.” –Dr. Sameer Hinduja, Co-Director of theCyberbullying Research Centerand Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University.
We take severe action when we become aware of people engaging in sextortion: we remove their account, take steps to prevent them from creating new ones and, where appropriate, report them to the NCMEC and law enforcement. Our expert teams also work to investigate and disrupt networks of these criminals, disable their accounts and report them to NCMEC and law enforcement – including several networks in the last year alone.
Now, we’re also developing technology to help identify where accounts maypotentiallybe engaging in sextortion scams, based on a range of signals that could indicate sextortion behavior. While these signals aren’t necessarily evidence that an account has broken our rules, we’re taking precautionary steps to help prevent these accounts from finding and interacting with teen accounts. This builds on thework we already doto prevent other potentially suspicious accounts from finding and interacting with teens.
One way we’re doing this is by making it even harder for potential sextortion accounts to message or interact with people. Now, any message requests potential sextortion accounts try to send will go straight to the recipient’s hidden requests folder, meaning they won’t be notified of the message and never have to see it. For those who are already chatting to potential scam or sextortion accounts, we showSafety Noticesencouraging them to report any threats to share their private images, and reminding them that they can say no to anything that makes them feel uncomfortable.
For teens, we’re going even further. We already restrict adults from starting DM chats with teens they’re not connected to, and in January we announcedstricter messaging defaults for teens under 16(under 18 in certain countries), meaning they can only be messaged by people they’re already connected to – no matter how old the sender is. Now, we won’t show the “Message” button on a teen’s profile to potential sextortion accounts, even if they’re already connected.We’re also testing hiding teens from these accounts in people’s follower, following and like lists, and making it harder for them to find teen accounts in Search results.
We’re testing new pop-up messages for people who may have interacted with an account we’ve removed for sextortion. The message will direct them to our expert-backed resources, including ourStop Sextortion Hub,support helplines, the option to reach out to a friend,StopNCII.orgfor those over 18, andTake It Downfor those under 18.
We’re also adding new child safety helplines from around the world into our in-app reporting flows. This means when teens report relevant issues – such as nudity, threats to share private images or sexual exploitation or solicitation – we’ll direct them to local child safety helplines where available.
In November, we announced we werefounding members of Lantern, a program run by the Tech Coalition that enables technology companies to share signals about accounts and behaviors that violate their child safety policies.
This industry cooperation is critical, because predators don’t limit themselves to just one platform – and the same is true of sextortion scammers. These criminals target victims across the different apps they use, often moving their conversations from one app to another. That’s why we’ve started to share more sextortion-specific signals to Lantern, to build on this important cooperation and try to stop sextortion scams not just on individual platforms, but across the whole internet.",,,,New Tools to Help Protect Against Sextortion and Intimate Image Abuse,"April 11, 2024",,"April 10, 2024",,en-en,"Safety, Scams, Well-Being, Public Policy, Safety and Expression",en,English,,,"Financial sextortionis a horrific crime.

This feature is designed not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude images to trick people into sending their own images in return.
Nudity protection will be turned on by default for teens under 18 globally, and we’ll show a notification to adults encouraging them to turn it on.
When nudity protection is turned on, people sending images containing nudity will see a message reminding them to be cautious when sending sensitive photos, and that they can unsend these photos if they’ve changed their mind.

Anyone who tries to forward a nude image they’ve received will see a message encouraging them to reconsider.

When someone receives an image containing nudity, it will be automatically blurred under a warning screen, meaning the recipient isn’t confronted with a nude image and they can choose whether or not to view it. We’ll also show them a message encouraging them not to feel pressure to respond, with an option to block the sender and report the chat.

When sending or receiving these images, people will be directed to safety tips, developed with guidance from experts, about the potential risks involved. These tips include reminders that people may screenshot or forward images without your knowledge, that your relationship to the person may change in the future, and that you should review profiles carefully in case they’re not who they say they are. They also link to a range of resources, includingMeta’s Safety Center,support helplines,StopNCII.orgfor those over 18, andTake It Downfor those under 18.

Nudity protection uses on-device machine learning to analyze whether an image sent in a DM on Instagram contains nudity. Because the images are analyzed on the device itself, nudity protection will work in end-to-end encrypted chats, where Meta won’t have access to these images – unless someone chooses to report them to us.
“Companies have a responsibility to ensure the protection of minors who use their platforms. Meta’s proposed device-side safety measures within its encrypted environment is encouraging. We are hopeful these new measures will increase reporting by minors and curb the circulation of online child exploitation.”–John Shehan, Senior Vice President, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
“As an educator, parent, and researcher on adolescent online behavior, I applaud Meta’s new feature that handles the exchange of personal nude content in a thoughtful, nuanced, and appropriate way. It reduces unwanted exposure to potentially traumatic images, gently introduces cognitive dissonance to those who may be open to sharing nudes, and educates people about the potential downsides involved. Each of these should help decrease the incidence of sextortion and related harms, helping to keep young people safe online.” –Dr. Sameer Hinduja, Co-Director of theCyberbullying Research Centerand Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University.
We take severe action when we become aware of people engaging in sextortion: we remove their account, take steps to prevent them from creating new ones and, where appropriate, report them to the NCMEC and law enforcement. Our expert teams also work to investigate and disrupt networks of these criminals, disable their accounts and report them to NCMEC and law enforcement – including several networks in the last year alone.
Now, we’re also developing technology to help identify where accounts maypotentiallybe engaging in sextortion scams, based on a range of signals that could indicate sextortion behavior. While these signals aren’t necessarily evidence that an account has broken our rules, we’re taking precautionary steps to help prevent these accounts from finding and interacting with teen accounts. This builds on thework we already doto prevent other potentially suspicious accounts from finding and interacting with teens.
One way we’re doing this is by making it even harder for potential sextortion accounts to message or interact with people. Now, any message requests potential sextortion accounts try to send will go straight to the recipient’s hidden requests folder, meaning they won’t be notified of the message and never have to see it. For those who are already chatting to potential scam or sextortion accounts, we showSafety Noticesencouraging them to report any threats to share their private images, and reminding them that they can say no to anything that makes them feel uncomfortable.
For teens, we’re going even further. We already restrict adults from starting DM chats with teens they’re not connected to, and in January we announcedstricter messaging defaults for teens under 16(under 18 in certain countries), meaning they can only be messaged by people they’re already connected to – no matter how old the sender is. Now, we won’t show the “Message” button on a teen’s profile to potential sextortion accounts, even if they’re already connected.We’re also testing hiding teens from these accounts in people’s follower, following and like lists, and making it harder for them to find teen accounts in Search results.
We’re testing new pop-up messages for people who may have interacted with an account we’ve removed for sextortion. The message will direct them to our expert-backed resources, including ourStop Sextortion Hub,support helplines, the option to reach out to a friend,StopNCII.orgfor those over 18, andTake It Downfor those under 18.
We’re also adding new child safety helplines from around the world into our in-app reporting flows. This means when teens report relevant issues – such as nudity, threats to share private images or sexual exploitation or solicitation – we’ll direct them to local child safety helplines where available.
In November, we announced we werefounding members of Lantern, a program run by the Tech Coalition that enables technology companies to share signals about accounts and behaviors that violate their child safety policies.
This industry cooperation is critical, because predators don’t limit themselves to just one platform – and the same is true of sextortion scammers. These criminals target victims across the different apps they use, often moving their conversations from one app to another. That’s why we’ve started to share more sextortion-specific signals to Lantern, to build on this important cooperation and try to stop sextortion scams not just on individual platforms, but across the whole internet.",New Tools to Help Protect Against Sextortion and Intimate Image Abuse,safety_tag,Meta,,na,https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/new-tools-to-help-protect-against-sextortion-and-intimate-image-abuse/,,,na,meta,34,m-meta-34,Yes,,,,4,"Yes, author info in the metadata is correct",,,,"Now, we won’t show the “Message” button on a teen’s profile to potential sextortion accounts, even if they’re already connected.

Since 2016, we have used a strategy called “remove, reduce, and inform” to manage problematic content across the Facebook family of apps. This involvesremovingcontent that violates our policies,reducingthe spread of problematic content that does not violate our policies andinformingpeople with additional information so they can choose what to click, read or share. This strategy applies not only during critical times likeelections, but year-round.
Today in Menlo Park, we met with a small group of journalists to discuss our latest remove, reduce and inform updates to keep people safe and maintain the integrity of information that flows through the Facebook family of apps:

Facebook
We haveCommunity Standardsthat outline what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook. They cover things like bullying, harassment and hate speech, and we remove content that goes against our standards as soon as we become aware of it. Last year, we made it easier for people to understand what we take down bypublishing our internal enforcement guidelinesand giving people the right toappeal our decisionson individual posts.
The Community Standards apply to all parts of Facebook, but different areas pose different challenges when it comes to enforcement. For the past two years, for example, we’ve been working on something called the Safe Communities Initiative, with the mission of protecting people from harmful groups and harm in groups. By using a combination of the latest technology, human review and user reports, we identify and remove harmful groups, whether they are public, closed or secret. We can now proactively detect many types of violating content posted in groups before anyone reports them and sometimes before few people, if any, even see them.
Similarly, Stories presents its own set of enforcement challenges when it comes to both removing and reducing the spread of problematic content. The format’s ephemerality means we need to work even faster to remove violating content. The creative tools that give people the ability to add text, stickers and drawings to photos and videos can be abused to mask violating content. And because people enjoy stringing together multiple Story cards, we have to view Stories as holistic — if we evaluate individual story cards in a vacuum, we might miss standards violations.
In addition to describing this context and history, today we discussed how we will be:

There are types of content that are problematic but don’t meet the standards for removal under ourCommunity Standards, such as misinformation and clickbait. People often tell us that they don’t like seeing this kind of content and while we allow it to be posted on Facebook, we want to make sure it’s not broadly distributed.
Over the last two years, we’ve focused heavily onreducing misinformationon Facebook. We’re getting better at enforcing againstfake accounts and coordinated inauthentic behavior; we’re using both technology and people to fight the rise inphoto and video-based misinformation; we’ve deployed new measures to help peoplespot false newsand get morecontextabout the stories they see in News Feed; and we’ve grown our third-party fact-checking program to include 45 certified fact-checking partners who review content in 24 languages.

Today we discussed how Instagram is working to ensure that the content we recommend to people is both safe and appropriate for the community. We have begun reducing the spread of posts that are inappropriate but do not go againstInstagram’s Community Guidelines, limiting those types of posts from being recommended on our Explore and hashtag pages.

"Yesterday the Wall Street Journal published astoryclaiming that Facebook “shut down efforts to make the site less divisive” and “largely shelved” internal research on whether social media increases polarization. Unfortunately, this particular story wilfully ignored critical facts that undermined its narrative.
The piece uses a couple of isolated initiatives we decided against as evidence that we don’t care about the underlying issues—and it ignored the significant efforts we did make. The piece disregarded how our research, andresearch we continue to commission, informed dozens of other changes and new products. It also ignored other measures we’ve taken to fight polarization. As a result, readers were left with the impression we are ignoring an issue that in fact we have invested heavily in.
Here are just some of the initiatives we’ve made over the past three years to address factors that can contribute to polarization:
Recalibrating News Feed
In 2018we made a fundamental changeto the way content is surfaced in people’s News Feed to prioritize posts from friends and family over news content. This was based on extensive research that found people derive more meaningful conversations and experiences when they engage with people they know rather than by passively consuming content.
This was one of many changes we’ve made to Facebook’s News Feed to try and minimize the amount of divisive news content people see. We’vereduced clickbait headlines. We’vereduced links to misleading and spammy posts. And we’veimproved how comments are rankedto show people those that are more relevant and of higher quality.
Building a Robust Integrity Team
Over the past four years, we’ve built a global team of more than 35,000 people working across the company on issues to secure the safety and security of our services, including those related to polarization.We’ve removed billions of fake accounts. We made it easier to see who is behind political ads. And we’ve updated our privacy settings and built new tools to give people more control over their information.
Restricting Recommendations
We’ve added more restrictions to the types of Pages and Groups that we recommend to people. Through our tools, we can detect many types of violating content posted in Groups before people report it to us. If Pages and Groupsrepeatedlyshare content that violates our Community Standards, or is rated false by fact-checkers, we reduce their distribution, remove them from recommendations, and weremove the abilityfor Pages to monetize and advertise. We also remove entire Pages and Groups who repeatedly post violating content. When reviewing a Group to decide whether or not to take it down, we will look at admin and moderator content violations, including posts by members that they have approved, as a stronger signal that the Group violates our standards.
Combating Hate Speech
Another way we reduce polarization is byprohibiting speechthat attacks people based on what we call protected characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability hate speech on our platforms. We’ve expanded our proactive detection technology to find such content faster and in more languages. Today almost 90% of hate speech we remove is detected by our systems before anyone reports it to us.
Reducing Misinformation and Removing Content That Could Cause Physical Harm
Misinformation is often a tool used in polarizing content and fighting it has been a key focus.
In December of 2016, we launched anindependent fact-checking programthat became the basis for evaluating whether content posted to Facebook is actually true. Content found to be false by our fact-checking partners is labelled and down-ranked in News Feed. We’ve sinceexpanded the program to Instagramand now have more than 60 fact-checking partners covering more than 50 languages around the world.
Andwe’ve updated our policiesto remove misinformation that has the potential to contribute to imminent violence, physical harm, and voter suppression.
Finally, the Journal examined a rigorous process we instituted called ‘eat your veggies’ that was designed to vet new products before they were shipped. The process was put in place as a response to valid criticism, including from the media, that tech companies weren’t doing enough to anticipate unintended uses of their products.
We’ve taken a number of important steps to reduce the amount of content that could drive polarization on our platform, sometimes at the expense of revenues. This job won’t ever be complete because at the end of the day, online discourse is an extension of society and ours is highly polarized. But it is our job to reduce polarization’s impact on how people experience our products. We are committed to doing just that.",,,,Investments to Fight Polarization,"May 27, 2020",,"December 22, 2021",,en-en,"Combating Hate Speech, Combating Misinformation, Integrity and Security, Public Policy",en,English,,,"Yesterday the Wall Street Journal published astoryclaiming that Facebook “shut down efforts to make the site less divisive” and “largely shelved” internal research on whether social media increases polarization.

"Facebook threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide range of threats includingcyber espionage campaigns,influence operationsand hacking of our platform by nation-state actors and other groups. As part of these efforts, our teams routinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them, notifying users if they should take steps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings publicly and continuing to improve the security of our products.
Today, we’re sharing actions we took against a group of hackers in China known in the security industry asEarth EmpusaorEvil Eye— to disrupt their ability to use their infrastructure to abuse our platform, distribute malware and hack people’s accounts across the internet. They targeted activists, journalists and dissidents predominantlyamong Uyghurs from Xinjiang in China primarily living abroad in Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United States, Syria, Australia, Canada and other countries. This group used various cyber espionage tactics to identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable surveillance.
This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation while obfuscating who’s behind it. On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself. We saw this activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies’ actions to disrupt their activity.
We identified the following tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat actor across the internet:
We shared our findings and threat indicators with industry peers so they too can detect and stop this activity. To disrupt this operation, we blocked malicious domains from being shared on our platform, took down the group’s accounts and notified people who we believe were targeted by this threat actor.

"Today, Facebook’s Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg joined G7 government and industry leaders for a meeting in Paris on how to curb the spread of terrorism and extremism online. At the meeting, hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Facebook along with Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Amazon signed up to theChristchurch Call to Action. The technology companies also committed to a nine-point plan that sets out concrete steps the industry will take to address the abuse of technology to spread terrorist content. The following is a statement from all five companies:
“The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence.
The Christchurch Call announced today expands on the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), and builds on our other initiatives with government and civil society to prevent the dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content.Additionally, we are sharing concrete steps we will take that address the abuse of technology to spread terrorist content, including continued investment in technology that improves our capability to detect and remove this content from our services, updates to our individual terms of use, and more transparency for content policies and removals.
Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that Governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.”
And here’s the nine-point plan:
As online content sharing service providers, we commit to the following:
Five Individual Actions
Terms of Use.We commit to updating our terms of use, community standards, codes of conduct, and acceptable use policies to expressly prohibit the distribution of terrorist and violent extremist content. We believe this is important to establish baseline expectations for users and to articulate a clear basis for removal of this content from our platforms and services and suspension or closure of accounts distributing such content.
User Reporting of Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content.We commit to establishing one or more methods within our online platforms and services for users to report or flag inappropriate content, including terrorist and violent extremist content. We will ensure that the reporting mechanisms are clear, conspicuous, and easy to use, and provide enough categorical granularity to allow the company to prioritize and act promptly upon notification of terrorist or violent extremist content.
Enhancing Technology.We commit to continuing to invest in technology that improves our capability to detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content online, including the extension or development of digital fingerprinting and AI-based technology solutions.
Livestreaming.We commit to identifying appropriate checks on livestreaming, aimed at reducing the risk of disseminating terrorist and violent extremist content online. These may include enhanced vetting measures (such as streamer ratings or scores, account activity, or validation processes) and moderation of certain livestreaming events where appropriate. Checks on livestreaming necessarily will be tailored to the context of specific livestreaming services, including the type of audience, the nature or character of the livestreaming service, and the likelihood of exploitation.
Transparency Reports.We commit to publishing on a regular basis transparency reports regarding detection and removal of terrorist or violent extremist content on our online platforms and services and ensuring that the data is supported by a reasonable and explainable methodology.
Four Collaborative Actions
Shared Technology Development.We commit to working collaboratively across industry, governments, educational institutions, and NGOs to develop a shared understanding of the contexts in which terrorist and violent extremist content is published and to improve technology to detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively and efficiently. This will include:
Crisis Protocols.We commit to working collaboratively across industry, governments, and NGOs to create a protocol for responding to emerging or active events, on an urgent basis, so relevant information can be quickly and efficiently shared, processed, and acted upon by all stakeholders with minimal delay. This includes the establishment of incident management teams that coordinate actions and broadly distribute information that is in the public interest.
Education.We commit to working collaboratively across industry, governments, educational institutions, and NGOs to help understand and educate the public about terrorist and extremist violent content online. This includes educating and reminding users about how to report or otherwise not contribute to the spread of this content online.
Combatting Hate and Bigotry.We commit to working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hate online. This includes providing greater support for relevant research – with an emphasis on the impact of online hate on offline discrimination and violence – and supporting capacity and capability of NGOs working to challenge hate and promote pluralism and respect online.",,,,Facebook Joins Other Tech Companies to Support the Christchurch Call to Action,"May 15, 2019",,"November 7, 2019",,en-en,"Counterterrorism, Integrity and Security, Safety and Expression",en,English,,,"Today, Facebook’s Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg joined G7 government and industry leaders for a meeting in Paris on how to curb the spread of terrorism and extremism online.

"We want to do everything we can to keep people safe on Instagram.We’ve worked withexperts to better understand the deeply complex issues of mental health, suicide and self-harm, and how best to support those who are vulnerable. No one at Instagram takes these issues lightly, including me.We’ve made progressover the past few years, and today we’re rolling out more technology in Europe to help with our efforts. But our work here is never done and we need to constantly look for ways to do more.
We recognize that these are deeply personal issues for the people who are affected. They are also complicated and always evolving, which is why we continue to update our policies and products so we can best support our community. We’ve never allowed anyone to promote or encourage suicide or self-harm on Instagram, andlast year we updated our policies to remove all graphic suicide and self-harm content. We also extended our policies to disallow fictional depictions like drawings, memes or other imagery that shows materials or methods associated with suicide or self-harm.
It’s not enough to address these difficult issues through policies and products alone. We also believe it’s important to provide help and support to the people who are struggling. Weoffersupport to people who search for accounts or hashtags related to suicide and self-harm and direct them to local organizations that can help. We’ve also collaborated with Samaritans, the suicide prevention charity, on theirindustry guidelines, which are designed to help platforms like ours strike the important balance between tackling harmful content and providing sources of support to those who need it.
We use technologyto help us proactively find and remove more harmful suicide and self-harm content. Our technology finds posts that may contain suicide or self-harm content and sends them to human reviewers to make the final decision and take the right action. Those actions include removing the content; connecting the poster to local organizations who can help; or, in the most severe cases, calling emergency services. Between April and June this year, over 90% of the suicide and self-harm content we took action on was found by our own technology before anyone reported it to us. But our goal is to get that number as close as we possibly can to 100%.
Until now,we’ve only been able to use this technologyto find suicide and self-harm contentoutsidethe European Union, which made it harder for us to proactively find content and send people help. I’m pleased to share that, today in the EU, we’re rolling out some of this technology, which will work across both Facebook and Instagram. We can now look for posts that likely break our rules around suicide and self-harm and make them less visible by automatically removing them from places like Explore. And when our technology is really confident that a post breaks our rules, we can now automatically remove it altogether.
This is an important step that will protect more people in the EU. But we want to do a lot more. The next step is using our technology not just to find the content and make it less visible, but to send it to our human reviewers and get people help, like we do everywhere else in the world. Not having this piece in place in the EU makes it harder for us to remove more harmful content, and connect people to local organizations and emergency services.We’re in current discussions with regulators and governments about how best to bring this technology to the EU, while recognizing their privacy considerations. We think and hope we can find the right balance so that we can do more. These issues are too important not to push for more.
We believe our community should be able to hold us accountable for how well we enforce our policies and take action on harmful content. That’s why we publish regular Community Standards Enforcement Reports to share global data on how much violating content we’re taking action on, and what percentage of that content we’re finding ourselves, before it’s reported.

"Multi-User Services lets groups of friends interact together at the same time within the same Lens. Location-Based Services anchors Lenses to places using our city templates, or any custom location around the world. Central London is the first City Landmarker available now, with more launching over the next year. Storage Services make it possible to build complex and interactive Lenses by storing assets in our cloud, and call on them, on-demand. Snapchatters will also be able to pick up where they last left off through persistent data support. Storage Services will launch in the coming months. Snap AR is our developer platform, and together with our community, we’re expanding what’s possible through our Camera. There are more than 250,000 creators, developers and partners from nearly every country in the world building on Snap AR. The community has tapped into their creativity and technical skills to build over 2.5 million Snapchat Lenses that have been viewed over 5 trillion times. Creators are building careers and fully-fledged businesses with our technology, and we’re continually offering new ways to support their endeavors. From the Snap Lens Network to GHOST , our programs provide funding, early access to new tools, and greater reach to Snapchatters globally. They’re also building a future beyond mobile with our next generation Spectacles . Hundreds of developers are using new capabilities like hand tracking, VoiceML, and Connected Lens technology to build new ways of interacting with AR. New AR Tools All of their creation and exploration begins with Lens Studio . Today, we’re releasing a new version so developers can build Lenses that are more dynamic and look true to life. With our API Library, Lenses can surface real-time financial, translation, and weather data from partners, ultimately making more useful and rich AR experiences. We’re expanding the API Library with new partners AstrologyAPI and Sportradar, so Lenses can tap into frequently-updating information like daily horoscopes and live sports scores. We’re also improving our Lens Analytics feature with Event Insights, offering creators a look at what happens while their Lenses are in use. We hope this makes it easier for creators to debug issues and build experiences that bring people back again and again. And coming soon, Ray Tracing will let reflections shine from AR objects in a lifelike way. It’s the first time this feature will scale across a wide range of mobile devices, enabling console-quality realism across platforms. Partners like Tiffany & Co. will bring a signature piece into AR that sparkles with precision, while Disney and Pixar will take Buzz Lightyear's iconic space suit to infinity and beyond in an AR try-on Lens. As developers push the limits of AR creation, we want to empower them with an advanced suite of services that vastly expands what a Lens can do. So, we’re introducing Lens Cloud, a free collection of backend services that enables Lenses to be more useful, dynamic, and connected to the world than ever before. There are three main services: Multi-User Services lets groups of friends interact together at the same time within the same Lens.

We’re excited to see how developers leverage Lens Cloud and Lens Studio together to build a new generation of AR experiences that enhance the way we play, learn, explore, and shop. Camera Kit The Snap AR platform not only powers Lens experiences on Snapchat and Spectacles, but also in other mobile applications through Camera Kit . With our AR SDK, any developer or partner can leverage Snap’s Camera technology in their own mobile app, unleashing new ways for AR to bring a new dimension to their customer experience. Camera Kit has been adopted by a wide range of partners – from global brands like Samsung, Disney, and Microsoft’s Flipgrid, to developers building an app for the first time. This year, we’ll continue to work with new partners to integrate Camera Kit, develop new use cases, and push the boundaries of AR.

"Today, we’re releasing our transparency report for the first half of 2021, which covers the period of January 1 - June 30 of this year. As with recent reports, this installment shares data about violations of our Community Guidelines globally during the period; the number of content reports we received and enforced against across specific categories of violations; how we responded to requests from law enforcement and governments; our enforcements broken down by country; the Violative View Rate of Snapchat content; and incidences of false information on the platform. We’re adding several updates to our reporting this period, including noting our median turnaround time in minutes from hours to provide more detail about our operational practices and efficacy. Every day, on average more than five billion Snaps are created using our Snapchat camera. From January 1 - June 30, 2021, we enforced against 6,629,165 pieces of content globally that violated our Guidelines. During this period, our Violative View Rate (VVR) was 0.10 percent, which means that out of every 10,000 views of content on Snap, 10 contained content that violated our Guidelines. Additionally, we significantly improved our time responding to reports of violations, in particular for sexually explicit content, harassment and bullying, illegal and counterfeit drugs, and other regulated goods. Our Work To Combat Child Sexual Abuse Material The safety of our community is a top priority. As a platform built for communicating with real friends, we intentionally designed Snapchat to make it harder for strangers to find young people. For example, Snapchatters cannot see each others’ friend lists, and by default, cannot receive a message from someone who isn’t already a friend. We have zero tolerance for abuse directed at any member of our community, especially minors, which is illegal, unacceptable and prohibited by our Community Guidelines. We work diligently to combat these violations by evolving our capabilities to prevent, detect and eradicate abuse on our platform including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and other types of child sexually exploitative content. Our Trust and Safety teams use proactive detection tools, such as PhotoDNA and Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI) Match technology to identify known illegal images and videos of CSAM and report them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC then, in turn, coordinates with domestic or international law enforcement. In the first half of 2021, 5.43 percent of the total number of accounts we enforced against globally contained CSAM. Of this, we proactively detected and actioned 70 percent of CSAM violations. This increased proactive detection capability combined with a rise in CSAM-spreading coordinated spam attacks resulted in a notable increase in this category for this reporting period. We have continued to expand our partnerships with safety experts as well as our in-app features to help educate Snapchatters about the risks of contact with strangers and how to use in-app reporting to alert our Trust and Safety teams to any type of concern or abuse. Additionally, we have continued to add partners to our trusted flagger program, which provides vetted safety experts with a confidential channel to report emergency escalations, such as an imminent threat to life or a case involving CSAM. We work closely with these partners to provide safety education, wellness resources, and other reporting guidance so they can help support the Snapchat community. Our Approach to the Spread of False Information The period of time this transparency report covers further underscores how critical it is to ensure that the public has access to accurate and credible information. We regularly assess and invest in new means of protecting our community of Snapchatters from the spread of false information related to democratic processes, public health, and COVID-19. In the first half of 2021, globally, we enforced against a combined total of 2,597 accounts and pieces of content for violations of our false information guidelines, almost half the number of violations from the previous reporting period. Since content on Discover and Spotlight are proactively moderated to prevent distribution of violating content at scale, the majority of these violations came from private Snaps and Stories, and the majority of these violations were made known to us via our own active moderation efforts, as well as reports from Snapchatters. We have always believed that when it comes to harmful content, it isn’t enough just to think about policies and enforcement — platforms need to consider their fundamental architecture and product design. From the beginning, Snapchat was built differently than traditional social media platforms, to support our primary use case of talking with close friends — rather than an open newsfeed where anyone has the right to distribute anything to anyone. Snapchat’s very design limits virality, which removes incentives for content that appeals to people’s worst instincts thereby limiting concerns associated with the spread of illegal and harmful content. This approach also carries into our work to prevent the spread of extremist content. During the reporting period, we removed five accounts for violations of our prohibition of terrorist and extremist content, a slight decrease from the last reporting cycle. At Snap, we’re regularly monitoring developments in this space, seeking to mitigate any potential vectors for abuse on our platform. Both our platform architecture and the design of our Group Chat functionality help to limit the spread of harmful content and opportunities to organize. We offer Group Chats, but they are limited in size, are not recommended by algorithms, and are not discoverable on our platform for anyone not a member of that particular Group. During this period, we continued to proactively promote factual public safety information about COVID-19 to our community, including through coverage provided by our Discover editorial partners, through public service announcements (PSAs), as well as Q&As with public health officials, agencies and medical experts, and through creative tools, such as Augmented Reality Lenses and filters — all designed to remind Snapchatters of expert public health guidance. Earlier this year, as vaccines became available for young people in the U.S., we launched a new initiative with the White House to help Snapchatters answer common questions and, in July, we teamed up with the UK’s National Health Service on a similar effort. Going forward, we are committed to continuing to make our transparency reports more comprehensive and helpful to the many stakeholders that care deeply about online safety, transparency and multi-sector accountability. We are constantly evaluating how we can strengthen our comprehensive efforts to combat harmful content and bad actors, and are grateful to the many security and safety partners and collaborators that regularly help us to improve.",,,,News & Press Releases | Snapchat News,"November 22, 2021",,,,it-IT - es-ES - ko-KR - ja-JP - fr-FR - pt-BR - de-DE - en-US,,en,USA,,,"Today, we’re releasing our transparency report for the first half of 2021, which covers the period of January 1 - June 30 of this year.

On the occasion of International Women's Day, March 8, 2023, Snap's AR Studio in Paris is honoring 8 emblematic women in 8 major French cities (Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Lille, Strasbourg, Metz, and Nantes) through a unique augmented reality experience: 8th of March, 8 women . While just as many women as men have changed the course of French history, the vast majority of sculptures in French urban spaces  (squares, gardens, and streets) only honor male figures. Snap's AR Studio has thus imagined AR statues of women who have left their mark on French history in the politics, arts, philosophy and military fields. These AR statues are installed next to the physical statues of their male counterparts, honoring the achievements of these great women and celebrating their contributions to women's rights and condition in the French society. 8th of March, 8 women The AR experience 8th of March, 8 women will be available from March 8, 2023, and will feature the following important female figures in French history: Simone Veil: Champion of women’s rights, emblem of the 1975 law that legalized abortion, and the first female president of the European Parliament. Her augmented reality statue will be positioned next to the physical one of General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Elysées roundabout in Paris. Simone de Beauvoir: An acclaimed writer and philosopher of the existentialist movement. As an anti-conformist, she advocated for the emancipation of women in her writings, such as her 1949 book The Second Sex, and became one of the pioneers of French feminism in the 20th century. Her augmented reality statue will be placed next to the physical one of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry at Place Bellecour in Lyon. Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun: Admitted to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1783 and the official painter to Marie Antoinette, she achieved critical and popular success in the artistic world despite the many obstacles facing female artists of her time. Her augmented reality statue will be placed next to the physical one of Pierre Puget in the Parc Borély in Marseille. Françoise de Graffigny: One of the most emblematic female figures of 18th century French literature, best  known for her philosophical essay Letters from a Peruvian Woman published in 1747. Her augmented reality statue will be positioned next to the physical one of Montesquieu at Place des Quinconces in Bordeaux. Manon Tardon: Figure of the French Resistance and Free France, she was present on May 8, 1945, in Berlin when the surrender of Nazi Germany was signed.

To design this augmented reality experience, a team dedicated to the project within AR Studio Paris, including a female 3D artist and a female AR engineer, conceived, sculpted the statues and developed the interactivity, in order to bring these augmented reality experiences to life and offer representations of these women as close to reality as possible. ""Through this innovative experience installed in 8 cities in France, we want to pay tribute to 8 women who have changed French history and society through their actions, their writings, or their positions. Thanks to Snap's augmented reality technologies, we were able to celebrate those 8 women by building their statues in the public space and placing them alongside statues of men. By establishing a silent dialogue between these historical figures, our wish is to raise public awareness of the fight for women's rights.""  — Donatien Bozon, AR Studio Director.

"Hello, Snapchat community! My name is Jacqueline Beauchere and I joined Snap last Fall as the company’s first Global Head of Platform Safety. My role focuses on enhancing Snap’s overall approach to safety, including creating new programs and initiatives to help raise awareness of online risks; advising on internal policies, product tools and features; and listening to and engaging with external audiences – all to help support the safety and digital well-being of the Snapchat community. Since my role involves helping safety advocates, parents, educators and other key stakeholders understand how Snapchat works and to solicit their feedback, I thought it might be useful to share some of my initial learnings about the app; what surprised me; and some helpful tips, if you or someone close to you is an avid Snapchatter. Initial Learnings – Snapchat and Safety After more than 20 years working in online safety at Microsoft, I’ve seen significant change in the risk landscape. In the early 2000s, issues like spam and phishing highlighted the need for awareness-raising to help educate consumers and minimize socially engineered risks. The advent of social media platforms – and people’s ability to post publicly – increased the need for built-in safety features and content moderation to help minimize exposure to illegal and potentially more harmful content and activity. Ten years ago, Snapchat came onto the scene. I knew the company and the app were “different,” but until I actually started working here, I didn’t realize just how different they are. From inception, Snapchat was designed to help people communicate with their real friends – meaning people they know “in real life” – rather than amassing large numbers of known (or unknown) followers. Snapchat is built around the camera. In fact, for non-first-generation Snapchatters (like me), the app’s very interface can be a bit mystifying because it opens directly to a camera and not a content feed like traditional social media platforms. There’s far more that goes into Snapchat’s design than one might expect, and that considered approach stems from the tremendous value the company places on safety and privacy. Safety is part of the company’s DNA and is baked into its mission: to empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. Unless people feel safe, they won’t be comfortable expressing themselves freely when connecting with friends. The belief that technology should be built to reflect real-life human behaviors and dynamics is a driving force at Snap. It’s also vital from a safety perspective. For example, by default, not just anyone can contact you on Snapchat; two people need to affirmatively accept each other as friends before they can begin communicating directly, similar to the way friends interact in real life. Snap applies privacy-by-design principles when developing new features and was one of the first platforms to endorse and embrace safety-by-design, meaning safety is considered in the design phase of our features – no retro-fitting or bolting on safety machinery after the fact. How a product or feature might be misused or abused from a safety perspective is considered, appropriately so, at the earliest stages of development. What Surprised Me – Some Context Behind Some Key Features Given my time in online safety and working across industry, I’d heard some concerns about Snapchat. Below are a handful of examples and what I’ve learned over the past few months. Content that Deletes by Default Snapchat is probably most known for one of its earliest innovations: content that deletes by default. Like others, I made my own assumptions about this feature and, as it turns out, it’s something other than I’d first presumed. Moreover, it reflects the real-life-friends dynamic. Snapchat’s approach is rooted in human-centered design. In real life, conversations between and among friends aren’t saved, transcribed or recorded in perpetuity. Most of us are more at ease and can be our most authentic selves when we know we won’t be judged for every word we say or every piece of content we create. One misperception I’ve heard is that Snapchat’s delete-by-default approach makes it impossible to access evidence of illegal behavior for criminal investigations. This is incorrect. Snap has the ability to, and does, preserve content existing in an account when law enforcement sends us a lawful preservation request. For more information about how Snaps and Chats are deleted, see this article . Strangers Finding Teens A natural concern for any parent when it comes to online interactions is how strangers might find their teens. Again, Snapchat is designed for communications between and among real friends; it doesn’t facilitate connections with unfamiliar people like some social media platforms. Because the app was built for communicating with people we already know, by design, it’s difficult for strangers to find and contact specific individuals. Generally, people who are communicating on Snapchat have already accepted each other as friends. In addition, Snap has added protections to make it even more difficult for strangers to find minors, like banning public profiles for those under 18. Snapchat only allows minors to surface in friend-suggestion lists (Quick Add) or Search results if they have friends in common. A newer tool we want parents and caregivers to be aware of is Friend Check-Up, which prompts Snapchatters to review their friend lists to confirm those included are still people they want to be in contact with. Those you no longer want to communicate with can easily be removed. Snap Map and Location-Sharing Along those same lines, I’ve heard concerns about the Snap Map – a personalized map that allows Snapchatters to share their location with friends, and to find locally relevant places and events, like restaurants and shows. By default, location-settings on Snap Map are set to private (Ghost Mode) for all Snapchatters. Snapchatters have the option of sharing their location, but they can do so only with others whom they’ve already accepted as friends – and they can make location-sharing decisions specific to each friend. It’s not an “all-or-nothing” approach to sharing one’s location with friends. Another Snap Map plus for safety and privacy: If people haven’t used Snapchat for several hours, they’re no longer visible to their friends on the map. Most importantly from a safety perspective, there’s no ability for a Snapchatter to share their location on the Map with someone they’re not friends with, and Snapchatters have full control over the friends they choose to share their location with or if they want to share their location at all. Developing and deploying new technology to detect drug-related activity on Snapchat to, in turn, identify and remove drug dealers who abuse the platform; Reinforcing and taking steps to bolster our support for law enforcement investigations, so authorities can quickly bring perpetrators to justice; and Raising awareness of the dangers of fentanyl with Snapchatters via public service announcements and educational content directly in the app. (You can learn more about all of these efforts here .) Harmful Content Early on, the company made a deliberate decision to treat private communications between friends, and public content available to wider audiences, differently. In the more public parts of Snapchat, where material is likely to be seen by a larger audience, content is curated or pre-moderated to prevent potentially harmful material from “going viral.” Two parts of Snapchat fall into this category: Discover, which includes content from vetted media publishers and content creators, and Spotlight, where Snapchatters share their own entertaining content with the larger community. On Spotlight, all content is reviewed with automated tools, but then undergoes an extra layer of human moderation before it is eligible to be seen, currently, by more than a couple dozen people. This helps to ensure the content complies with Snapchat’s policies and guidelines, and helps to mitigate risks that may have been missed by automoderation. By seeking to control virality, Snap lessens the appeal to publicly post illegal or potentially harmful content, which, in turn, leads to significantly lower levels of exposure to hate speech, self-harm and violent extremist material, to name a few examples – as compared with other social media platforms. Exposure to Drugs Snapchat is one of many online platforms that drug dealers are abusing globally and, if you’ve seen any media coverage of parents and family members who’ve lost children to a fentanyl-laced counterfeit pill, you can appreciate how heartbreaking and terrifying this situation can be. We certainly do, and our hearts go out to those who’ve lost loved ones to this frightening epidemic. Over the past year, Snap has been aggressively and comprehensively tackling the fentanyl and drug-related content issue in three key ways: Developing and deploying new technology to detect drug-related activity on Snapchat to, in turn, identify and remove drug dealers who abuse the platform; Reinforcing and taking steps to bolster our support for law enforcement investigations, so authorities can quickly bring perpetrators to justice; and Raising awareness of the dangers of fentanyl with Snapchatters via public service announcements and educational content directly in the app. (You can learn more about all of these efforts here .) We’re determined to make Snapchat a hostile environment for drug-related activity and will continue to expand on this work in the coming months. In the meantime, it’s important for parents, caregivers and young people to understand the pervasive threat of potentially fatally fake drugs that has spread across online platforms, and to talk with family and friends about the dangers and how to stay safe. Snap has much planned on the safety and privacy fronts in 2022, including launching new research and safety features, as well as creating new resources and programs to inform and empower our community to adopt safer and healthier digital practices.

On Spotlight, all content is reviewed with automated tools, but then undergoes an extra layer of human moderation before it is eligible to be seen, currently, by more than a couple dozen people. This helps to ensure the content complies with Snapchat’s policies and guidelines, and helps to mitigate risks that may have been missed by automoderation. By seeking to control virality, Snap lessens the appeal to publicly post illegal or potentially harmful content, which, in turn, leads to significantly lower levels of exposure to hate speech, self-harm and violent extremist material, to name a few examples – as compared with other social media platforms. Exposure to Drugs Snapchat is one of many online platforms that drug dealers are abusing globally and, if you’ve seen any media coverage of parents and family members who’ve lost children to a fentanyl-laced counterfeit pill, you can appreciate how heartbreaking and terrifying this situation can be. We certainly do, and our hearts go out to those who’ve lost loved ones to this frightening epidemic. Over the past year, Snap has been aggressively and comprehensively tackling the fentanyl and drug-related content issue in three key ways: Developing and deploying new technology to detect drug-related activity on Snapchat to, in turn, identify and remove drug dealers who abuse the platform; Reinforcing and taking steps to bolster our support for law enforcement investigations, so authorities can quickly bring perpetrators to justice; and Raising awareness of the dangers of fentanyl with Snapchatters via public service announcements and educational content directly in the app. (You can learn more about all of these efforts here .) We’re determined to make Snapchat a hostile environment for drug-related activity and will continue to expand on this work in the coming months. In the meantime, it’s important for parents, caregivers and young people to understand the pervasive threat of potentially fatally fake drugs that has spread across online platforms, and to talk with family and friends about the dangers and how to stay safe. Snap has much planned on the safety and privacy fronts in 2022, including launching new research and safety features, as well as creating new resources and programs to inform and empower our community to adopt safer and healthier digital practices.

"Intentional product safeguards; Clear and thoughtful policies; Diligent approach to political ads; Collaborative, coordinated operations; and Offering tools and resources to empower Snapchatters. Procedural interference : misinformation related to actual election or civic procedures, such as misrepresenting important dates and times or eligibility requirements for participation; Participation interference : content that includes intimidation to personal safety or spreads rumors to deter participation in the electoral or civic process; Fraudulent or unlawful participation : content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to participate in the civic process or to illegally cast or destroy ballots; and Delegitimization of civic processes : content aiming to delegitimize democratic institutions on the basis of false or misleading claims about election results, for example. Earlier this month, Snap, along with other major tech companies, received a letter from more than 200 civil society organizations, researchers, and journalists urging us to increase our efforts to protect the integrity of elections in 2024. We appreciate their advocacy and share their commitment to ensuring that people around the world can participate in their elections, while doing everything we can to help protect our democracy. Given the importance of these issues, and the deep responsibility we feel to the hundreds of millions of people who use Snapchat to communicate with their friends and family and learn more about the world through our content, we felt it was important to release our response publicly. You can read our letter below, and learn more about our plans for this year’s election here . *** April 21, 2024 Dear civil society organizations: Thank you for your ongoing vigilance and advocacy in this year of unprecedented electoral activity around the world. We’re grateful for the opportunity to share more about how Snap is approaching our responsibilities in this environment, and how these efforts map to the longstanding values of our company. Overview of the Snapchat Approach Our approach to election-related platform integrity is layered. At a high level, the core elements include: Intentional product safeguards; Clear and thoughtful policies; Diligent approach to political ads; Collaborative, coordinated operations; and Offering tools and resources to empower Snapchatters. Taken together, these pillars underpin our approach to mitigating a broad range of election-related risks, while also ensuring Snapchatters have access to tools and information that support participation in democratic processes throughout the world. 1. Intentional Product Safeguards From the outset, Snapchat was designed differently from traditional social media. Snapchat doesn’t open to a feed of endless, unvetted content, and it doesn’t allow people to live stream. We’ve long recognized that the greatest threats from harmful digital disinformation stem from the speed and scale at which some digital platforms enable it to spread. Our platform policies and architecture limit the opportunities for unvetted or unmoderated content to achieve meaningful scale unchecked. Instead, we pre-moderate content before it can be amplified to a large audience, and broadly limit the distribution of news and political information unless it comes from trusted publishers and creators (including, for example, media organizations like The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post in the US, Le Monde in France, and Times Now in India). Over this past year, the introduction of generative AI features on Snapchat has been met with the same level of intention. We limit our AI products’ abilities to generate content or imagery that could be used to undermine civic processes or deceive voters. Our chatbot, My AI, for example, may provide information about political events or context surrounding social issues; it is programmed not to offer opinions on political candidates or encourage Snapchatters to vote for a particular outcome. And in our text-to-image features, we’ve adopted system-level restrictions on the generation of risky content categories, including the likeness of known political figures. For more than a decade now, and across multiple election cycles, our product architecture has played a central role in creating a highly inhospitable environment for actors working to disrupt civic processes or undermine the information environment. And evidence suggests that it works well. Our most recent data indicates that from January 1 to June 30, 2023, the total number of enforcements globally for harmful false information (including risks to election integrity) represented 0.0038% of total content enforced, falling within the lowest likelihood categories of harm on our platform. We will continue to bring a product-forward approach to our platform integrity efforts in 2024, including our commitments as signatories to the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections . 2. Clear and Thoughtful Policies To complement our product safeguards, we’ve implemented a range of policies that function to advance safety and integrity in the context of high-profile events like elections. Our Community Guidelines expressly prohibit, for example, harmful false information, hate speech, and threats or calls to violence. On the topic of harmful content in connection with elections, our external policies are robust and informed by leading researchers in the field of information integrity. They spell out specific categories of harmful content that are prohibited, including: Procedural interference : misinformation related to actual election or civic procedures, such as misrepresenting important dates and times or eligibility requirements for participation; Participation interference : content that includes intimidation to personal safety or spreads rumors to deter participation in the electoral or civic process; Fraudulent or unlawful participation : content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to participate in the civic process or to illegally cast or destroy ballots; and Delegitimization of civic processes : content aiming to delegitimize democratic institutions on the basis of false or misleading claims about election results, for example.  Education : Provide factual and relevant content about elections, candidates, and issues through our content and talent partnerships on Discover. Registration : Encourage Snapchatters to register to vote leveraging third-party credible civic infrastructure. Engagement : Create excitement and energy in-app around civics and encourage Snapchatters to vote before/on Election Day. We also provide internal guidance to ensure that our moderation teams understand the ways that election risks often intersect with other categories of harm, including hate speech, misogyny, targeted harassment, or even impersonation. All of our policies apply to any form of content on our platform, whether user-generated or AI-generated. 1 We also make clear that all policies apply equally to all Snapchatters , irrespective of their prominence. In all cases, our approach to harmful deceptive content is straightforward: we remove it. We don’t label it, we don’t downrank it; we take it down. Snapchatters who violate our content rules receive a strike and a warning message; if they persist in such violations, they may lose their account privileges (though all Snapchatters are provided an opportunity to appeal our enforcement decision). 3. Diligent Approach to Political Ads As a platform that permits political advertising in connection with democratic elections, we’ve taken care to adopt rigorous practices to mitigate risks to election integrity. Most notably, every political ad on Snapchat is human-reviewed and fact-checked before it is eligible for placement on our platform. To support these efforts, we partner as needed with Poynter and other International Fact Checking Network-member organizations to provide independent, nonpartisan assessments of whether advertisers’ claims can be substantiated. Our vetting process for political ads includes a thorough check for any misleading use of AI to create deceptive images or content. To support transparency, an ad must clearly disclose who paid for it. And under our Political Ad Policies , we don’t allow ads to be paid for by foreign governments or any individuals or entities located outside of the country where the election is taking place. We believe it’s in the public’s interest to see which political ads are approved to run and keep a Political Ads Library that includes information about targeting, costs, and other insights. To ensure compliance with all of these processes, our Commercial Content Policies disallow influencers from promoting paid political content outside of traditional ad formats. This ensures that all paid political content is subject to our ad review practices and disclaimer requirements. 4. Collaborative, Coordinated Operations At Snap we take a highly collaborative approach to operationalizing our election integrity safeguards. Internally, we have convened a cross-functional election integrity team, including misinformation, political advertising, and cybersecurity experts, to monitor all relevant developments in connection with elections throughout the world in 2024. The breadth of representation in this group reflects our whole-of-company approach we take to safeguarding platform integrity, with representatives from Trust & Safety, Content Moderation, Engineering, Product, Legal, Policy, Privacy Operations, Security, and others. Across our content moderation and enforcement, we maintain language capabilities commensurate with all countries in which Snap operates. We have also operationalized a crisis response protocol, to ensure operational agility in the face of high-risk global events. This spirit of coordination extends to external collaborations as well. We routinely engage with democracy stakeholders and civil society organizations for advice, research insights, and to hear concerns or receive incident escalations. (Many signatories to your letter remain valued partners to us for these purposes.) We often brief governments and elections officials on our approach to platform integrity. We also participate in multi stakeholder initiatives, as we did this year, for example, working with civil society, elections authorities, and fellow industry stakeholders to help shape the Voluntary Election Integrity Guidelines for Technology Companies . And we welcome additional opportunities to engage constructively with all stakeholders in support of mitigating digital risks to civic processes. 5. Offering tools and resources to empower Snapchatters At Snap, we have always believed that civic engagement is one of the most powerful forms of self-expression. As a platform that helps people express themselves and has significant reach with new and first-time voters, we make it a priority to help our community get access to accurate and trusted information about news and world events, including where and how they can vote in their local election. In 2024, these efforts will focus on three pillars that have remained constant throughout the years: Education : Provide factual and relevant content about elections, candidates, and issues through our content and talent partnerships on Discover. Registration : Encourage Snapchatters to register to vote leveraging third-party credible civic infrastructure. Engagement : Create excitement and energy in-app around civics and encourage Snapchatters to vote before/on Election Day. Many of these plans are currently in the works for 2024, but they will build on many of the successes we’ve had over the years with connecting Snapchatters with informative resources. Conclusion At such a consequential moment both for democracies around the world and the acceleration of powerful new technologies, it is as important as ever that platforms are transparent about their values. And on this point, our values could not be clearer: we reject any abuse of our platform that threatens to undermine civic processes or poses a risk to Snapchatters’ safety.  We’re proud of our record to date, but we must continue to remain vigilant to election-related risks.

"Over the past week, we’ve listened to concerns about the Best Friends, Streaks, and Solar System features on Snapchat. While there may have been some confusion about how the features work, what is undoubtedly clear is that there are concerns about the impact these features have on our community’s well-being. We want to explain how these features work, why we built them, and what we plan to do going forward. Best Friends is a private feature that shows people who they talk to most frequently over a rolling time period. It’s a convenient feature because on Snapchat people typically spend most of their time talking to a small group of friends, even if they have a larger number of contacts on our service. By putting the friends you communicate with most frequently at the top of your contact list, they are easier to find when you want to send a Snap. We also use emojis to denote those friendships by adding a heart or a smiley face to make those people easier to find in your chat inbox. These emojis are not visible to others. Streaks are a private representation of how many consecutive days you’ve sent a Snap back and forth with one of your friends on Snapchat. People enjoy maintaining Streaks as a fun reminder to stay in touch with people that they care about. Over the years, we’ve received heartwarming notes from people who have reflected on the ways that Streaks have supported their friendships across the world and across time zones, through the good and the bad. When we received feedback from our community that they sometimes felt pressure to respond to a Snap to maintain their Streak, we made it easier to quickly restore lost Streaks. The Solar System is an optional, private feature that is only available with a Snapchat+ subscription and is used by less than 0.25% of our community each day, on average. It illustrates how frequently one of your friends communicates with you by showing your friend as the Sun and your Bitmoji avatar on a planet in our solar system. It does not show any other friends, it is not a numerical ranking, and it is not visible to anyone else. We built the Solar System because we received feedback from the Snapchat community that they wanted to know more about their friendships. Online conversations often lack the same context and social signals found during in-person conversations, and features like the Solar System help provide additional awareness and context. We’ve gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback from the Snapchat+ subscribers who use the Solar System feature, but we understand that even though it can feel good to know you are close to someone, it can also feel bad to know that you aren’t as close to a friend as you’d like to be. We’ve heard and understand that the Solar System can make that feeling worse, and we want to avoid that. We’re going to turn the Solar System feature off by default so that Snapchat+ subscribers who want more friendship insights can proactively turn it on, and those who don’t will never have to see it. We hope this strikes the right balance between providing a feature that is desired by many who use it while avoiding upsetting those who don’t want to use it. We will also take the time to further evaluate the feature and determine if there are additional ways that we could improve it for our community. It is very clear that we are at an important moment of reckoning when it comes to the impact of smartphone technology. We believe there are countless benefits to being able to stay in touch and build relationships online with our friends when we are physically separated from them, and we are committed to mitigating the potential downsides of online communication wherever possible. We built Snapchat to make online conversations feel more similar to real-world ones. That’s why people express themselves visually through Snaps, because a picture says a thousand words. We delete messages by default, to help people feel more comfortable like a face-to-face conversation. We don’t have public friend lists or public likes so that Snapchat doesn’t feel like a public popularity contest. We moderate content so that people aren’t exposed to things they don’t want to see. We believe that these design choices are the reason why people tell us that Snapchat makes them feel more happy, connected, and creative when using the service compared to traditional social media. 1 We also believe it’s why Snapchat is ranked as the number one happiest platform. 2 We are deeply committed to making a positive impact with our service. Snapchat is designed to facilitate close friendships, support them, and celebrate them. We hope these changes are a step in the right direction, and we will continue to listen to feedback from our community as we evolve our service.

While there may have been some confusion about how the features work, what is undoubtedly clear is that there are concerns about the impact these features have on our community’s well-being. We want to explain how these features work, why we built them, and what we plan to do going forward. Best Friends is a private feature that shows people who they talk to most frequently over a rolling time period. It’s a convenient feature because on Snapchat people typically spend most of their time talking to a small group of friends, even if they have a larger number of contacts on our service. By putting the friends you communicate with most frequently at the top of your contact list, they are easier to find when you want to send a Snap. We also use emojis to denote those friendships by adding a heart or a smiley face to make those people easier to find in your chat inbox. These emojis are not visible to others. Streaks are a private representation of how many consecutive days you’ve sent a Snap back and forth with one of your friends on Snapchat. People enjoy maintaining Streaks as a fun reminder to stay in touch with people that they care about. Over the years, we’ve received heartwarming notes from people who have reflected on the ways that Streaks have supported their friendships across the world and across time zones, through the good and the bad. When we received feedback from our community that they sometimes felt pressure to respond to a Snap to maintain their Streak, we made it easier to quickly restore lost Streaks. The Solar System is an optional, private feature that is only available with a Snapchat+ subscription and is used by less than 0.25% of our community each day, on average. It illustrates how frequently one of your friends communicates with you by showing your friend as the Sun and your Bitmoji avatar on a planet in our solar system. It does not show any other friends, it is not a numerical ranking, and it is not visible to anyone else. We built the Solar System because we received feedback from the Snapchat community that they wanted to know more about their friendships. Online conversations often lack the same context and social signals found during in-person conversations, and features like the Solar System help provide additional awareness and context. We’ve gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback from the Snapchat+ subscribers who use the Solar System feature, but we understand that even though it can feel good to know you are close to someone, it can also feel bad to know that you aren’t as close to a friend as you’d like to be. We’ve heard and understand that the Solar System can make that feeling worse, and we want to avoid that. We’re going to turn the Solar System feature off by default so that Snapchat+ subscribers who want more friendship insights can proactively turn it on, and those who don’t will never have to see it. We hope this strikes the right balance between providing a feature that is desired by many who use it while avoiding upsetting those who don’t want to use it. We will also take the time to further evaluate the feature and determine if there are additional ways that we could improve it for our community. It is very clear that we are at an important moment of reckoning when it comes to the impact of smartphone technology. We believe there are countless benefits to being able to stay in touch and build relationships online with our friends when we are physically separated from them, and we are committed to mitigating the potential downsides of online communication wherever possible. We built Snapchat to make online conversations feel more similar to real-world ones. That’s why people express themselves visually through Snaps, because a picture says a thousand words. We delete messages by default, to help people feel more comfortable like a face-to-face conversation. We don’t have public friend lists or public likes so that Snapchat doesn’t feel like a public popularity contest. We moderate content so that people aren’t exposed to things they don’t want to see. We believe that these design choices are the reason why people tell us that Snapchat makes them feel more happy, connected, and creative when using the service compared to traditional social media. 1 We also believe it’s why Snapchat is ranked as the number one happiest platform. 2 We are deeply committed to making a positive impact with our service. Snapchat is designed to facilitate close friendships, support them, and celebrate them. We hope these changes are a step in the right direction, and we will continue to listen to feedback from our community as we evolve our service.

"Black creators face unique systemic barriers across the creator industry - from disparities in compensation and attribution, to toxic experiences and more.  We believe one of the ways we can help remove some of those barriers is to provide mentorship and financial resources to emerging Black creators in the early stages of their professional career. Professional creators often have the education and tools necessary to monetize, request proper attribution and create ongoing opportunities. Today, we are excited to announce our first accelerator program focused on supporting 25 emerging, undiscovered Black talent on their journey to make content creation a full-time career. We are accepting applications through August 12. To apply, visit: https://523.snap.com/apply . Participants will be selected by early September. We partnered with Google Pixel, UNCMMN, and Westbrook Media to support participants with some of the best devices, industry mentors, hands-on learning experiences and financial backing. Snap will provide funding of $10,000 USD per month per creator for 12 months to assist participants’  creative endeavors. These creators will be selected based on their unique voices, alignment with Snap’s values, and vision for their career without giving preference to follower numbers or previous brand partnership experience. These creators will also have the opportunity to Beta test new features; leverage Snapchat’s content offerings like Stories, Spotlight, Maps; and attend educational webinars and SnapSchool to ensure their success on the platform. The launch of this accelerator program is part of our broader, ongoing efforts to ensure that content on our platform reflects the diversity of Snapchatters and their interests. We recently announced 523 , Snap's ecosystem of accelerators serving companies and creators from traditionally underrepresented groups. Yellow is our accelerator program targeted towards entrepreneurs who are building businesses, brands, and products that can contribute to human progress by helping people. In our 2021 Yellow accelerator class, seven out of nine companies have at least one BIPOC or woman founder; 52% of our founders are BIPOC; and 56% are BIPOC-founded companies. Historically, across all of our classes, 22 out of 39 companies had at least one BIPOC founder (56%). With over 80% of the US Gen Z Population watching a Snap Original last year, Snap continues to elevate voices and topics that matter to our community. Over the past two years, over 50% of leads or hosts in Snap Originals have identified as BIPOC or LGBTQIA+.

"Snapchat is a platform where creators of all kinds can meaningfully grow their audience, build their business and entertain our community. One year ago we launched Spotlight to lower the barrier to content creation and shine a light on the most entertaining Snaps created by the Snapchat community, no matter who created them. Spotlight is designed with our values at its core - profiles are private by default and all content is moderated before it can gain distribution. This is done to ensure that we reduce the risk of spreading misinformation, hate speech, or other potentially harmful content. We have been awed by the positivity of our community. Their talents, passions and unique perspectives are showcased on Spotlight every day, and it’s been exciting to see Snapchatters’ imaginations run wild while using Creative Tools. Our Cartoon 3D Style Lens, which uses machine learning to turn people into a 3D-animated cartoon in real-time, generated 2.8 billion impressions on Snapchat alone in its first week of release and we watched on Spotlight as our community recreated their favorite childhood movies with them (or their pets!) as the star. In fact, over 65% of Spotlight submissions use one of Snapchat’s Creative Tools or an augmented reality Lens. And we remain committed to rewarding Snapchatters for their creativity. Over the past year, more than 12,000 creators have collectively been paid over $250 million USD through our Spotlight and creator programs! In the year ahead, we’ll continue to offer a range of opportunities to meet the needs of creators as they entertain our community while growing their brand. And for our community, we’ll continue to make it even easier to follow and view content from your favorite creators - whether that be on Spotlight, Stories or Discover.

"Today, our co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel joined other tech platforms in testifying before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. You can read Evan’s full oral testimony presented before the Committee below. *** Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and members of the Committee, thank you for convening this hearing and for moving forward important legislation to protect children online. I am Evan Spiegel, the co-founder and CEO of Snap. We created Snapchat, an online service that is used by more than 800 million people worldwide, to communicate with their friends and family. I know that many of you have been working to protect children online since before Snapchat was created, and we are grateful for your long-term dedication to this cause and your willingness to work together to help keep our community safe. I want to acknowledge the survivors of online harms and the families who are here today who have suffered the loss of a loved one. Words cannot begin to express the profound sorrow I feel that a service we designed to bring people happiness and joy has been abused to cause harm. I want to be clear that we understand our responsibility to help keep our community safe. I also want to recognize the many families who have worked to raise awareness on these issues, pushed for change, and collaborated with lawmakers on important legislation like the Cooper Davis Act, which can help save lives. I started building Snapchat with my co-founder Bobby Murphy when I was twenty years old. We designed Snapchat to solve some of the problems that we experienced online when we were teenagers. We didn’t have an alternative to social media. That meant pictures shared online were permanent, public, and subject to popularity metrics. It didn’t feel very good. We built Snapchat differently because we wanted a new way to communicate with our friends that was fast, fun, and private. A picture is worth a thousand words, so people communicate with images and videos on Snapchat. We don’t have public likes or comments when you share your Story with friends. Snapchat is private by default, meaning that people need to opt-in to add friends and choose who can contact them. When we built Snapchat we chose to have the images and videos sent through our service delete by default. Like prior generations who have enjoyed the privacy afforded by phone calls, which aren’t recorded, our generation has benefitted from the ability to share moments through Snapchat that may not be picture perfect but instead convey emotion without permanence. Even though Snapchat messages are deleted by default, we let everyone know that images and videos can be saved by the recipient. When we take action on illegal or potentially harmful content, we also retain the evidence for an extended period, which allows us to support law enforcement and help hold criminals accountable. To help prevent the spread of harmful content on Snapchat, we approve the content that is recommended on our service using a combination of automated processes and human review. We apply our content rules consistently and fairly across all accounts. We run samples of our enforcement actions through quality assurance to verify that we are getting it right. We also proactively scan for known child sexual abuse material, drug-related content, and other types of harmful content, remove that content, deactivate and device-block offending accounts, preserve the evidence for law enforcement, and report certain content to the relevant authorities for further action. Last year we made 690,000 reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, leading to more than 1,000 arrests. We also removed 2.2 million pieces of drug-related content and blocked 705,000 associated accounts. Even with our strict privacy settings, content moderation efforts, proactive detection, and law enforcement collaboration, bad things can still happen when people use online services. That’s why we believe that people under the age of thirteen are not yet ready to communicate on Snapchat. We strongly encourage parents to use the device-level parental controls on iPhone and Android. We use them in our own household and my wife approves every app that our thirteen year old downloads. For parents who want more visibility and control, we built Family Center in Snapchat where you can view who your teen is talking to, review privacy settings, and set content limits. We have worked for years with members of the Committee on legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and the Cooper Davis Act which we are proud to support. I want to encourage broader industry support for legislation protecting children online. No legislation is perfect but some rules of the road are better than none. Much of the work that we do to protect the people that use our service would not be possible without the support of our partners across the industry, government, non-profit organizations, NGOs, and in particular, law enforcement and the first responders who have committed their lives to helping keep people safe. I am profoundly grateful for the extraordinary efforts across our country and around the world to prevent criminals from using online services to perpetrate their crimes. I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the opportunities that this country has afforded me and my family. I feel a deep obligation to give back and to make a positive difference and I am grateful to be here today as part of this vitally important democratic process. Members of the Committee, I give you my commitment that we will be part of the solution for online safety. We will be honest about our shortcomings, and we will work continuously to improve. Thank you and I look forward to answering your questions.",,,,Senate Congressional Testimony of Evan Spiegel as Delivered,"January 31, 2024",,,,en-US - fr-FR - pt-BR - de-DE - es-ES - ko-KR - ja-JP - ar - it-IT,,en,USA,,,"Today, our co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel joined other tech platforms in testifying before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

"At this year’s Lens Fest , the annual celebration of our global AR community, we added something entirely new to reward our AR creators: The Lens Fest Awards. Thanks to the outstanding work from our AR community, Snapchatters play with Lenses more than 6 billion times per day on average.* So, we’re celebrating AR achievements across nine categories including fashion & beauty, environment & social good, gaming, utility and more. Meet the creators, developers, and artists behind this year’s top AR experiences below! Best in Art & Expression -- ¡Vendedores, Presente! By: Sallia Goldstein Sallia Goldstein partnered with Los Angeles based artist Ruben Ochoa as part of our Monumental Perspectives initiative in partnership with LACMA. Together, they created a augmented reality monument that pays homage to the shared history of street vendors in L.A. Best in Creativity -- Rock Hand By: 2020CV’s Hart Woolery Hart, a serial entrepreneur and programmer since the age of 12 was inspired by the different ways that people pair art and music. To bring this magic to life through AR, he developed Rock Hand. This Lens nods to nostalgic games such as Rock Band, Guitar Hero and DDR, and reimagines that type of interactive experience in AR paired to modern day tunes. Best in Originality -- SKIN THIEF By: Denis Rossiev Ditch the polyjuice potion, Denis Rossiev’s SKIN THIEF Lens brings shape-shifting magic to life through AR! SKIN THIEF leverages body tracking technology to scan, capture and overlay your look onto someone else, allowing Snapchatters to (temporarily) pose as their friends.

Inspired by the recent emergence and ubiquitous use of QR codes at restaurants, Brielle’s Lens demonstrates how augmented reality can further enhance the ordering experience allowing viewers to see a dish in 3D before placing an order. With Food Menu, the days of craning over for a look at what the next table ordered are numbered . . . Best in Environmental & Social Good -- Bleached Seas By: Helena Papageorgiou Australia native, Helena Papageorgiou is using AR to start a discourse about a local problem with global implications: coral bleaching. As temperatures rise due to increased Co2 in the atmosphere, coral reefs are suffering.

Friends are our first line of defense against loneliness, and we generally make our best friends in childhood; on average we have known our closest friends for at least half of our lives. Most of us have lost touch with a close friend from childhood, with the majority wanting to rediscover that close connection. While most of us are keeping connected better through digital communication channels, we still need to develop our friendship skills to help us learn how to maintain friendships over distance and get back in touch if we do lose contact. Experts from around the world have provided advice and tips on how to do this, Snap has also created a new Friendship Time Capsule to help Snapchatters celebrate their friendships. Today, we released our second global Friendship study, interviewing 30,000 people across sixteen countries, to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic and global issues have impacted friendship. Seventeen experts on friendship from around the world contributed to the report. Talking in pictures and videos layered with creative tools like our augmented reality Lenses, Filters, and personal avatars Bitmoji, help Snapchatters express themselves and interact visually. They serve as an essential connector when meeting face to face is not an option and at this difficult time have enabled Snapchatters to feel closer to their best friends even as non-Snapchatters feel more distant. The Friendship Report sheds new light on how COVID is affecting friendship and what other major events in life also have an impact, including: COVID has brought some friends closer together, but also made some of us feel lonely.

Experts from around the world have provided advice and tips on how to do this, Snap has also created a new Friendship Time Capsule to help Snapchatters celebrate their friendships. The impact of COVID-19 Six months after much of the world has put in place social distancing restrictions, friends are having to find new ways to stay connected, and the long term effects are only just starting to become clear. “This is the biggest psychological experiment ever conducted, and we don’t know yet how it’s going to end.” Lydia Denworth, journalist and author. Two-thirds of friends say they are using online channels to communicate more than they would have before COVID-19 (66%) and for many those conversations have been deeper (49%), rather than focusing on surface-level topics. It appears digital communications are key to staying in touch when we’re apart, with a vast majority (79%) saying that they have helped friends maintain their relationship, regardless of age. Even though there’s been an uptick in outreach to friends, COVID-19 has also led to loneliness for some. Two-thirds of those we surveyed said they’ve felt lonely since the pandemic started (66%) - 8% higher than pre-COVID-19. Almost half of people (49%) say that being unable to see their friends has made them feel lonelier, with only a third feeling friends are reaching out to them as much as they would like (30%). In fact, a third of people (31%) felt that social distancing has weakened their relationships with friends. In total, a third of people we surveyed said that COVID-19 has affected their friendships. With just over half saying that it has led to them not feeling as close to their friends (53%). And nearly half of those surveyed agreed with the statement that they “felt more distant from friends because they couldn’t spend time in-person” (45%). Laavanya Kathiravelu, who studies friendship and migration, tells us that “although friendships continue to be maintained through apps, phone calls, and other mediated forms of communication, the disembodied element takes away from the full experience of friendship for many.” This may explain why there was a marked difference between Snapchatters who often communicate visually - and non-Snapchatters - with Snapchatters becoming closer to friends during the pandemic. Friendship researcher Donya Alinejad describes the importance of visual communication as creating “co-presence” which results in “a feeling of being together when you’re actually physically distant.” Feeling as though we’re actually together is important “for a whole host of reasons,” Alinejad says, particularly “for those who are in need of or require a kind of emotional support.” The upside is that, with the pandemic causing so much isolation, people genuinely want to reach out and check in on those they care about. Over a third of people (39%) say their friendships are more important to them now and nearly half of us are making an intentional choice to reach out to friends that they haven’t spoken to in a while (48%). The lockdown has [had] a kind of funneling effect. You reinforce specific ties and you set others apart. So, it really has strengthened some relationships during this period,” noted Guillaume Favre, sociologist. The one that got away and reconnection Last year, Snap’s Friendship Report found that friendships, especially those from childhood, have a huge impact on happiness and wellbeing. So, it was surprising to see this year that 79% of us globally have lost touch with a close friend but heartening that 66% say they would like to rekindle their relationship. In the US, those numbers are higher, at 88% and 71% respectively. And we would generally respond positively to one of our best friends re-establishing contact, with the most prominent emotions being delighted (36%), or excited (29%), whereas a minority would feel awkward (14%), or suspicious (6%). How do we find our way back to close friends? Well over two thirds of people (67%) would prefer reconnecting digitally, but only around half of people would know how to (54%).  The number one thing people would like to send to their friends, would be a photo of them together (42%), with the number two being a photo that reminded them of a shared memory (40%). Humor also ranks highly, with a third thinking that sending a funny meme or GIF would be the best way to start a conversation (31%). Over a third (35%) would like tools to use to help communicate, especially in tough situations like getting back in touch. How to be a better friend There are plenty of resources for people struggling with relationships like family or marriage, but friendship hasn’t received the same treatment. This has left many without the tools or confidence they need to develop and navigate the ups and downs of friendships. British lecturer Gillian Sandstrom, who studies social psychology, talks about the “liking gap,” where we are prone to think people like us less than they actually do. This bias breeds insecurity about engaging in conversations. We fear awkward pauses and failed connections so much that foregoing the opportunity to start a friendship or deepen a relationship can be the safer choice. People are more likely to like you than you think, so go ahead and be brave. Listening, staying present, and accepting responsibility are key friendship skills. Honing these skills can take a little work, but with some lessons and practice, our experts agree we can improve our friendships.",,,,Our 2020 Friendship Report,"October 28, 2020",,,,it-IT - ko-KR - es-ES - ja-JP - de-DE - pt-BR - fr-FR - en-US,,en,USA,,,"COVID has brought some friends closer together, but also made some of us feel lonely.

"Leighton McDonald’s creative career started at an unlikely venue: the football field. He was at practice when a college representative noticed his sketches and paintings—a fortuitous moment that eventually led him to study industrial design at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). It was at SCAD where Leighton was first exposed to augmented reality. After getting into a senior class his junior year, Leighton worked on a project rendering models of underground pipes using AR and three-dimensional modeling, and he was later invited to London to showcase the design. Now, in addition to his art and his work forecasting trends for major apparel brands, Leighton also has a freelance business creating augmented reality experiences and he is one among a group of developers working on new experiences for Snapchat’s latest Spectacles. His latest Lens, Blacksoul Gallery, which can be viewed on mobile as well, highlights the work of emerging Black artists, bringing their work to new audiences outside the traditional walls of museums and galleries. “At first, I wanted to make an AR game, but that wasn’t touching me in my soul,” said Leighton when asked about his inspiration. In addition to its impact in the digital space, Blacksoul Gallery is also helping build connections IRL. Today, Leighton remains close friends with the artists he found and featured . In fact, his Lens even served as a platform for these artists, who have gone on to work on new partnerships, projects and commissions after being featured in Blacksoul Gallery on Snapchat.

"Today, we’re announcing an expanded strategic partnership with Google Cloud to power generative AI experiences within My AI, our AI-powered chatbot and one of the largest consumer chatbots available today. We will leverage the strong multimodal capabilities of Gemini on Vertex AI, particularly the technology’s ability to understand and operate across different types of information like text, audio, image, video, and code, to offer more engaging and innovative features for our Snapchat community through My AI. For example, with Gemini on Vertex AI integrated into the app, Snapchatters can ask My AI to translate a photo of a street sign while traveling abroad, or take a video of different snack offerings to ask which one is the healthiest option. As we continue to invest in AI, we’re already seeing strong business value from our partnership with Google Cloud.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, TikTok has provided access to public health information from experts on our app, as well as a relief for frontline workers and families. We are proud when our community comes together through memorable challenges — like #wipeitdown and #happyathome — that connect us and bring joy during difficult times. As COVID-19 vaccines are developed and approved, we are stepping up our efforts to support the well-being of our community by providing reliable information about vaccines. At the same time, we continue to remove misinformation about the coronavirus and vaccines.

Over the next week, our in-app hub of information from health experts about the coronavirus will be updated with common questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines. It can be accessed on our Discover page, in search results, and in banners on COVID-19 and vaccine-related videos. All of these videos have been viewed more than 2 billion times globally in the past six months. We’re also partnering with Team Halo to enable scientists around the world to share progress on the vaccine through video updates.

Educating our community

We’re working to educate and empower our community about our policies through in-app videos, notifications, and safety tools. This month, when a user opens TikTok, we’ll ask them to review these updated guidelines.

Keeping our community safe is a commitment with no finish line. We recognize the responsibility we have to our users to be agile in our detection and response when new types of content and behaviors emerge. To that end, we’ll continue to advance our policies, develop technology to automatically detect violative content, build features that help people manage their presence and content choices on TikTok, and empower our community to help us foster a trustworthy environment.

"Three months ago, welaunched Topicsto make it easier to find the most interesting conversations happening on Twitter about the things you love. Since then, people have asked to learn more about how Topics work. So, we want to provide some background on how specific Topics are selected, the process to find the best Tweets for you about these Topics, and how we seek to highlight healthy conversations. How Topics are chosen Right now, there are roughly 1,000 Topics you can follow via theTopicbrowser, which will then show you Tweets about those Topics in your Home timeline. And we’re adding new Topics almost every week. We add new Topics based on the volume and health of conversations happening on Twitter. We start by looking at the volume of conversation on Twitter: how much people are Tweeting, Retweeting, replying, and liking Tweets about that Topic. The more conversation, the more likely it will be evaluated for inclusion in our next batch of available Topics. Topics reflect the broader, lasting conversations people have about the events, people, and things they discuss. Once we’ve identified a new Topic, we then shift our focus to identifying the most relevant Tweets. Finding the most relevant Tweets on a Topic To find the full set of Tweets about a Topic, we use a combination of methods including looking at the text of Tweets as well as signals generated by machine learning solutions highlighting what Tweets might be about. At times, our teams and external partners may also help source accounts to be included in certain Topics. To find the most relevant Tweets, we start by identifying the people on Twitter who are most interested in a given Topic using using a combination of machine learning, curation, and keywords.* This could mean they Tweet a lot about the Topic or interact a lot with Tweets about the Topic. From there, we find the Tweets that are most interesting to those people, using additional algorithms that look at many signals from those fan accounts including what types of content they engage with or specific accounts that are most relevant. Our systems check to confirm these Tweets are relevant to the Topic by looking at a series of related keywords. Keeping Topics healthy A healthy conversation about Topics is one where you want and feel safe to participate. We’ve implemented a number of protections so that the conversations included in a Topic should be healthy and free fromabuse. This includes working to not recommend Tweets for a Topic if the engagement ismanipulated or spammy. We look at a number of underlying signals, including how others interact with both the Tweet and the author — things like reports, blocks, and whether people have dismissed similar recommendations by clicking “show less often” or muting closely-related keywords. These are just some of the signals we use when ranking and filtering the group of Tweets until we have a set we are confident recommending for that Topic. And, to be clear: Tweets that criticize, satirize, or disagree within a Topic are a natural part of a healthy conversation and are eligible for inclusion. These protections are on top of all of thehealth protections we’ve already put in place for other parts of Twitter. In addition to the processes described above, there are quality assurance checks with a globally distributed team of people to confirm Topics are accurately highlighting relevant and healthy conversations. If Topics are unfollowed frequently or Tweets within Topics are reported often, these could be signals that those Topic Tweets might not be pertinent and healthy. If this is happening, we may pause the Topic temporarily. We know people are trusting us by following Topics and that Topics offer additional amplification to Tweets, so we want to make sure we’re amplifying relevant, healthy conversations. Personalizing the Topic for you When you follow a Topic, the Tweets you see about that Topic in your timeline are personalized. Your past activity — like your Tweets and Tweets you’ve liked, replied to, or Retweeted — are used to identify the Tweets you'll find most interesting. Also, if you engage more with one Topic, like Dogs, versus another Topic, like cats, we’ll show you more of the Dog Topic. (Sorry cat lovers!) To wrap it up, let’s use one of my favorite Topics, BLACKPINK, as an example. For the BLACKPINK Topic, accounts regularly Tweeting about and engaging with the KPOP band generally or a specific band member, like a fan account, are found. From there, Tweets that would be interesting to those fan accounts are gathered using the method described above. Throughout this process, our systems are at work ensuring we are surfacing the conversations you want to see. From that narrowed pool, depending on what might be most interesting to you, say which band member you Tweet about or reply to Tweets about the most, you may see a Tweet about Lisa or Jennie. After all that, the best BLACKPINK Topic Tweet for you is ready to be shown in your Home timeline! This is just the start, we’ll keep working to improve Topics. We hope you like it. 👍 If you don’t see a Topic you want to follow yet, don’t worry. We’re adding new Topics almost every week. Topics are available in English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Korean. We’d love to hear how you are liking Topics. Do the Topics you follow show interesting Tweets? When you follow a Topic, do you see too many or too few related Tweets? We’ll keep tweaking our systems to make Topics better. You can give feedback on Topic Tweets by tapping the down arrow on the Tweet and choosing “Show less often.” *Updated July 2, 2020 to elaborate on how Tweets about a Topic are discovered and clarify that for certain Topics, our teams and external partners may help source accounts to be included.

We start by looking at the volume of conversation on Twitter: how much people are Tweeting, Retweeting, replying, and liking Tweets about that Topic. The more conversation, the more likely it will be evaluated for inclusion in our next batch of available Topics. Topics reflect the broader, lasting conversations people have about the events, people, and things they discuss. Once we’ve identified a new Topic, we then shift our focus to identifying the most relevant Tweets. Finding the most relevant Tweets on a Topic To find the full set of Tweets about a Topic, we use a combination of methods including looking at the text of Tweets as well as signals generated by machine learning solutions highlighting what Tweets might be about. At times, our teams and external partners may also help source accounts to be included in certain Topics. To find the most relevant Tweets, we start by identifying the people on Twitter who are most interested in a given Topic using using a combination of machine learning, curation, and keywords.* This could mean they Tweet a lot about the Topic or interact a lot with Tweets about the Topic. From there, we find the Tweets that are most interesting to those people, using additional algorithms that look at many signals from those fan accounts including what types of content they engage with or specific accounts that are most relevant. Our systems check to confirm these Tweets are relevant to the Topic by looking at a series of related keywords. Keeping Topics healthy A healthy conversation about Topics is one where you want and feel safe to participate. We’ve implemented a number of protections so that the conversations included in a Topic should be healthy and free fromabuse. This includes working to not recommend Tweets for a Topic if the engagement ismanipulated or spammy. We look at a number of underlying signals, including how others interact with both the Tweet and the author — things like reports, blocks, and whether people have dismissed similar recommendations by clicking “show less often” or muting closely-related keywords. These are just some of the signals we use when ranking and filtering the group of Tweets until we have a set we are confident recommending for that Topic. And, to be clear: Tweets that criticize, satirize, or disagree within a Topic are a natural part of a healthy conversation and are eligible for inclusion. These protections are on top of all of thehealth protections we’ve already put in place for other parts of Twitter. In addition to the processes described above, there are quality assurance checks with a globally distributed team of people to confirm Topics are accurately highlighting relevant and healthy conversations. If Topics are unfollowed frequently or Tweets within Topics are reported often, these could be signals that those Topic Tweets might not be pertinent and healthy. If this is happening, we may pause the Topic temporarily. We know people are trusting us by following Topics and that Topics offer additional amplification to Tweets, so we want to make sure we’re amplifying relevant, healthy conversations. Personalizing the Topic for you When you follow a Topic, the Tweets you see about that Topic in your timeline are personalized. Your past activity — like your Tweets and Tweets you’ve liked, replied to, or Retweeted — are used to identify the Tweets you'll find most interesting. Also, if you engage more with one Topic, like Dogs, versus another Topic, like cats, we’ll show you more of the Dog Topic. (Sorry cat lovers!) To wrap it up, let’s use one of my favorite Topics, BLACKPINK, as an example. For the BLACKPINK Topic, accounts regularly Tweeting about and engaging with the KPOP band generally or a specific band member, like a fan account, are found. From there, Tweets that would be interesting to those fan accounts are gathered using the method described above. Throughout this process, our systems are at work ensuring we are surfacing the conversations you want to see. From that narrowed pool, depending on what might be most interesting to you, say which band member you Tweet about or reply to Tweets about the most, you may see a Tweet about Lisa or Jennie. After all that, the best BLACKPINK Topic Tweet for you is ready to be shown in your Home timeline! This is just the start, we’ll keep working to improve Topics. We hope you like it. 👍 If you don’t see a Topic you want to follow yet, don’t worry. We’re adding new Topics almost every week. Topics are available in English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Korean. We’d love to hear how you are liking Topics. Do the Topics you follow show interesting Tweets? When you follow a Topic, do you see too many or too few related Tweets? We’ll keep tweaking our systems to make Topics better. You can give feedback on Topic Tweets by tapping the down arrow on the Tweet and choosing “Show less often.” *Updated July 2, 2020 to elaborate on how Tweets about a Topic are discovered and clarify that for certain Topics, our teams and external partners may help source accounts to be included.

"As wesharedearlier this year, we believe it’s critical to study the effects of machine learning (ML) on the public conversation and share our findings publicly. This effort is part of our ongoing work to look at algorithms across a range of topics. We recentlyshared the findingsof our analysis of bias in our image cropping algorithm and how they informed changes in our product. Today, we’republishing learningsfrom another study: an in-depth analysis of whether our recommendation algorithms amplify political content. The first part of the study examines Tweets from elected officials* in seven countries (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Since Tweets from elected officials cover just a small portion of political content on the platform, we also studied whether our recommendation algorithms amplify political content from news outlets. Since 2016, people on Twitter have been able to choose between viewing algorithmically ordered Tweets first in the Home timeline or viewing the most recent Tweets in reverse chronological order. An algorithmicHome timelinedisplays a stream of Tweets from accounts you have chosen to follow on Twitter, as well as recommendations of other content we think you might be interested in based on accounts you interact with frequently, Tweets you engage with, and more. As a result, what an individual sees on their Home timeline is a function of how they interact with the algorithmic system, as well as how the system is designed. The purpose of this study was to better understand the amplification of elected officials’ political content on our algorithmically ranked Home timeline versus the reverse chronological Home timeline. We hope our findings will contribute to an evidence-based discussion of the role these algorithms play in shaping political content consumption on the internet. In our study, we examined algorithmic amplification of political content in theHome timelineby asking the following questions: How we conducted the studyWe analyzed millions of Tweets from April 1 to August 15, 2020, from accounts operated by elected officials in seven countries. We used this data to test whether or not these Tweets are amplified more on the algorithmically ranked Home timeline than the reverse chronological feed and whether there was variance within a party. We used public, third-party sources (such as official institutional websites) to identify political party affiliation. We did not use Tweet content to attempt to infer political views of elected officials. To study algorithmic amplification of news outlets, we analyzed hundreds of millions of Tweets containing links to articles shared by people on Twitter during the same time period. The outlets were categorized based on media bias ratings from two independent organizations,AllSidesandAd Fontes Media. We excluded Tweets pointing to non-political content such as recipes or sports. What did we find? You can read the entirety of our findings in the paperhere. What’s next?In this study, we identify what is happening: certain political content is amplified on the platform. Establishing why these observed patterns occur is a significantly more difficult question to answer as it is a product of the interactions between people and the platform. The ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team’s mission, as researchers and practitioners embedded within a social media company, is to identify both, and mitigate any inequity that may occur. This research study highlights the complex interplay between an algorithmic system and people using the platform. Algorithmic amplification is not problematic by default – all algorithms amplify. Algorithmic amplification is problematic if there is preferential treatment as a function of how the algorithm is constructed versus the interactions people have with it. Further root cause analysis is required in order to determine what, if any, changes are required to reduce adverse impacts by our Home timeline algorithm. How can these findings be validated?It’s important for us to share the data we used to conduct this study so other researchers can reproduce our work. To aid this, we are making aggregated datasets available for third party researchers who wish to reproduce our main findings and validate our methodology, upon request. Details on what is included in this data are given in the paper. For full transparency, researchers would ideally have access to the raw data from which these aggregates were calculated, but this is extremely difficult without compromising privacy. For the past several months, META has been looking into methods to responsibly make available large datasets to support validation. We’re finalizing a partnership to leverage privacy preserving technology to enable third-party researchers to reproduce this type of work, while also protecting and safeguarding the privacy of people who use Twitter.  This approach is new and hasn’t been used at this scale, but we are optimistic that it will address the privacy-vs-accountability tradeoffs that can hinder algorithmic transparency. We’re excited about the opportunities this work may unlock for future collaboration with external researchers looking to reproduce, validate and extend our internal research. We’ll share more about this partnership soon. We hope that by sharing this analysis today, we can help spark a productive conversation with the broader research community to examine various hypotheses for why we are generally observing comparatively more right-leaning political amplification of elected officials’ content on Twitter.

Tweets about political content from elected officials, regardless of party or whether the party is in power, do see algorithmic amplification when compared to political content on the reverse chronological timeline.  
Group effects did not translate to individual effects. In other words, since party affiliation or ideology is not a factor our systems consider when recommending content, two individuals in the same political party would not necessarily see the same amplification. 
In six out of seven countries — all but Germany — Tweets posted by accounts from the political right receive more algorithmic amplification than the political left when studied as a group.
Right-leaning news outlets, as defined by the independent organizations listed above, see greater algorithmic amplification on Twitter compared to left-leaning news outlets.

"Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it. It’s true. Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. And there may be no better example of this thanmixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013. Who saw that coming? Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones.

It’s true. Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. And there may be no better example of this thanmixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet.

"As of November 2022, Birdwatch is nowCommunity Notes. We’ve been piloting ourBirdwatchprogram for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility ofBirdwatch notes— written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US. Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation. You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not. Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service. The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as abridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out ourBirdwatch guidefor more info on this. Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed aBirdwatch onboarding processthrough which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view. According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed. We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithmpublicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you’re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above.

"This weekMedia Matters for Americaposted a story that completely misrepresented the real user experience on X, in another attempt to undermine freedom of speech and mislead advertisers. Above everything, including profit, X works to protect the public’s right to free speech.

"As we work to improve the health of the public conversation, we’re committed to reaching beyond Twitter’s virtual walls to integrate diverse perspectives that make our service better for everyone. That’s why we regularly collaborate with trusted partners on ourTrust and Safety Councilto develop products and programs, and to improve the Twitter Rules. Today, we’re sharing a recap of some of the work we’ve accomplished hand-in-hand with these trusted partners, as well as more about our ongoing commitment to incorporating the expertise of global experts, researchers, and developers to support healthy public conversation on Twitter. Incorporating feedback to make Twitter safer We know the best version of Twitter is the one built by the people who use it. Over the past year, we’ve engaged with the Trust and Safety Council on thirteen projects early in the development process. We distilled and put to use their feedback on ways we can offer a better and safer experience for people using Twitter. Their feedback directly informed our approach on several products.  Transparency is core to Twitter’s approach. Through initiatives such as our opendeveloper platform, ourinformation operations archive, and our disclosures in theTwitter Transparency Centerand Lumen, we continue to support third-party research of what’s happening on Twitter. We’ll continue to build on these efforts and inform the public as we improve Twitter in the open. The following are highlights from the past year. What’s next? Increasing transparency and understanding on our approach to content moderation As we continue to invite trusted partners and the public to share feedback on ways to make Twitter safe, it’s important to be transparent about how we develop and enforce the Twitter Rules. Our newly formed Content Governance Initiative (CGI) aims to do this by developing a governance framework that provides a consistent and principled approach to the development, enforcement, and assessment of our global rules and policies. To build our governance framework, we’re engaging external stakeholders and have created an additional advisory group on ourTrust and Safety Council. We’ll continue collaborating with this group and cross-functional teams across Twitter to establish standardized guidelines on policy development, enforcement, and appeals that help drive a common understanding of Twitter’s approach to content moderation. The framework's principles and guidelines will aim to fulfill the following objectives: We recognize that achieving these objectives will not be easy. Content moderation at scale is a highly complex and challenging process. This initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to working systematically — in partnership with external stakeholders around the world — to improve the transparency and consistency of our content moderation processes.

"As of November 2022, Birdwatch is nowCommunity Notes. People come to Twitter to stay informed, and they want credible information to help them do so. We apply labels and add context to Tweets, but we don't want to limit efforts to circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention. We also want to broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem, and we believe a community-driven approach can help. That’s why today we’re introducing Birdwatch, a pilot in the US of a new community-driven approach to help address misleading information on Twitter. Here’s how it works Birdwatch allows people to identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable. Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors. In this first phase of the pilot, notes will only be visible on a separateBirdwatch site. On this site, pilot participants can also rate the helpfulness of notes added by other contributors. These notes are being intentionally kept separate from Twitter for now, while we build Birdwatch and gain confidence that it produces context people find helpful and appropriate. Additionally, notes will not have an effect on the way people see Tweets or our system recommendations. Building together To date, we have conducted more than 100 qualitative interviews with individuals across the political spectrum who use Twitter, and we received broad general support for Birdwatch. In particular, people valued notes being in the community’s voice (rather than that of Twitter or a central authority) and appreciated that notes provided useful context to help them better understand and evaluate a Tweet (rather than focusing on labeling content as  “true” or “false”). Our goal is to build Birdwatch in the open, and have it shaped by the Twitter community. To that end, we’re also taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent: We hope this will enable experts, researchers, and the public to analyze or audit Birdwatch, identifying opportunities or flaws that can help us more quickly build an effective community-driven solution. We want to invite anyone to sign up and participate in this program, and know that the broader and more diverse the group, the better Birdwatch will be at effectively addressing misinformation. More details on how to applyhere. What’s next We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors. We’ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot. From embedding a member of the University of Chicago’s Center for RISC on our team to hosting feedback sessions with experts in a variety of disciplines, we’re also reaching beyond our virtual walls and integrating social science and academic perspectives into the development of Birdwatch. We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying.

"Twitter is where people come to see what’s happening and to hear from their governments and government officials. We believe that safety and free expression go hand-in-hand, especially when interacting with these leaders and associated institutions, and adding context to what people see on Twitter helps them have a more informed experience on Twitter. In August 2020, weexpanded account labelsto two additional categories: 1) the accounts of key government officials and 2) accounts belonging to state-affiliated media entities. Included in this initial action were accounts from countries represented in the five permanent members of theUN Security Council. After receiving feedback on this initial action from a range of stakeholders — including civil society, academia, and those who use our service — on Wednesday, February 17, we will expand these labels to accounts from Group of Seven (G7) countries, and to a majority of countries that Twitter has attributedstate-linked information operationsto.

"More on our approach in English and Swahili On Tuesday 9th August, Kenyan voters will be heading to the polls for the 2022 General Elections, where they will vote to elect a new President, as well as voting to elect members of the National Assembly, and members of the Kenyan Senate. In addition to this, local county governors and candidates for the country's 47 county assemblies will also be on the ballot this year for voters’ consideration. Elections on Twitter During any election,Twitter serves as a centralised hub for real-time political conversation and commentary, electoral resources, journalistic reports live from the campaign trail as well as a tool for people to hear directly from political representatives themselves. Our work to make Twitter an engaging and healthy platform for political discourse is long standing; in 2019 webanned political adsas we believe political messaging should be earned, not bought; we’ve expanded our policies aroundelection misinformationand continue to add context and notices to Tweets withmanipulated media, to ensure people have the context they need. 2022 Kenyan Elections Today, we wanted to share the steps we’ve taken and the trusted local partnerships we have, ahead of the 2022 Kenyan elections, ensuring the debate on Twitter is healthy, open and safe. Our work also ensures that Twitter continues to serve as the go-to place for people to see what’s happening, participate in the conversation, track campaign trails and consume verified information, so voters can make informed choices about what’s most important to them in this election. Partnerships As we work to improve the health of the public conversation - particularly during civic events like elections - we are committed to reaching beyond Twitter to intergrate diverse perspectives that make our service better for everyone. As part of that, we have partnered with a number of organisations to further amplify credible information during the Kenyan election. Elevate Credible Information:One such partner isAfrica Check; established in 2012 as the continent’s first independent, nonpartisan fact-checking organisation that debunks dangerous statements, and empowers people to engage with information critically, while also building a culture of fact-checking across Africa. In the build-up to the Kenyan elections, Africa Check - which is part of theFumbuacollective, continues to combat false narratives, amplify accurate information and lead the activation of critical media literacy work across the region. ""We are pleased to collaborate with Twitter as part of our election work in Kenya. The collaboration will allow us to address dis- and misinformation by fact-checking claims and identifying potential misinformation. We will also highlight accurate, verified information ahead of the election on the platform so that voters can make informed decisions. Media literacy programmes are a proactive strategy to fight misinformation and allow us to use our fact-checking work to inoculate people against false information proactively and empower them to critically understand, analyse, and evaluate information instead of simply consuming and sharing it. We believe this enables them to make evidence-based decisions vital ahead of elections. Notably, the partnership with Twitter will deepen the impact of our media literacy project as it will allow us to reach a broader audience.""- Africa Check This work is key to the protection of the election conversation and we look forward to continued partnerships and collaboration with Africa Check and all our other partner organisations, up to and after the Kenyan elections. Verification Ahead of the elections, Twitter worked with Kenyan partner organisations on verifying accounts of Government Agencies, Candidates, Political Parties, Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs), News Organisations and content creators. The blue Verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic and notable - giving people on Twitter more context about who they’re having conversations with so they can determine the way in which they engage with a certain account. Amplifying Credible Information Our teams are working to ensure that voters in Kenya are directed to credible information while they spend time on our platform. In line with our efforts to amplify credible information, we have been able to launch the following features: Policy enforcement In addition to enforcing our Policies onHateful Conduct and Abusive Behaviour,we have implemented a clearCivic Integrity Policyso that people  cannot use Twitter’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. The Policy targets the most directly harmful types of content, such as (but not limited to) misleading information about how to participate in an election or misleading information that intends to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in an election. Labeling:As such, in line with this policy, we will label Tweets that contain false or misleading information that undermines confidence in the election or false or misleading information related to the outcomes of the election. Tweets that are labeled under this policy will therefore have reduced visibility (not amplified) across the service and will lead to Twitter Moments with informative context on the topic - based on official, reliable sources and fact-checkers. Local engagement Our Sub-Saharan Africa policy team has also offered safety and security training to partner organisations, bringing them through tools such as mute, block and report, as well as various security tips and techniques such as two-factor authentication. The established cross-functional 2022 Kenyan elections team at Twitter, will work to protect the integrity of the election-related conversation, support partner groups and political representatives as well as identifying and curbing any threat to the integrity of the 2022 Kenyan election conversation on Twitter. We are committed to providing a service that fosters and facilitates political debate and we will continue to build on one of our core priorities, which is to protect political and civic conversation on Twitter through our policies, products and the integral partnerships we have around the world. Sources for relevant election related information -- Uchaguzi Mkuu wa Kenya, 2022 unafanyika kwenye Twitter Siku ya Jumanne ya tarehe 9 Agosti, wapiga kura wa Kenya watakuwa wakielekea kwenye vituo vya kupiga kura kwa ajii ya Uchaguzi Mkuu wa mwaka 2022, ambapo watapiga kura kuchagua Raisi mpya, Wabunge, na wawakilishi wa Bunge la Seneta la Kenya. Wakati huo huo, mwaka huu wapiga kura watapiga kura kuchagua wawakilishi wa serikali za ugatuzi na magavana wa kaunti zote 47. Uchaguzi kwenye Twitter Katika chaguzi zote, Twitter hutumika kama kituo cha majadiliano na maoni ya wakati halisi, chanzo cha habari za uchaguzi, sehemu ya waandishi wa habari kutoa taarifa za moja kwa moja kutoka kwenye mikutano ya kampeni na pia chombo ambacho kinawawezesha watu kuwasikia wawakilishi wao wa kisiasa moja kwa moja. Juhudi zetu za kuifanya Twitter kuwa jukwaa la majadiliano ya kisiasa ambalo ni shirikishi na lenye tija zimekuwa zikiendelea kwa muda mrefu sasa; mwaka 2019tulizuia matangazo ya kisiasakwa sababu tunaamini kwamba umaarufu wa kisiasa huja wenyewe, pasipo kununuliwa; tumeimarisha sera zetu kuhusuupotoshaji wa uchaguzina tunaendelea kuongeza maudhui na taarifa kwenye machapisho yenye maudhui yanayopotosha, ili kuhakikisha kwamba watu wanapata muktadha wanaohitaji.. Uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022 Leo, tungependa kuwaeleza juu ya hatua tulizochukua na washirika wa ndani tulionao tunapoelekea kwenye uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022, ili kuhakikisha kuwa mijadala inayoendelea kwenye Twitter ni bora, ya wazi na salama. Kazi yetu pia inahakikisha kuwa Twitter inaendelea kuwa sehemu ambayo watu wanatembelea kuona mambo yanayoendelea, kushiriki mazungumzo, kufuatilia kampeni na kupata taarifa za kuaminika ili wapiga kura waweze kuchagua yale ambayo ni muhimu kwao wakiwa na taarifa sahihi kwenye uchaguzi huu. Ushirikiano Tunapoendelea kufanya kazi kuimarisha ubora wa mazungumzo ya umma (hasa zaidi ya wakati wa matukio ya kiraia kama uchaguzi) tumedhamiria kufika maeneo mengine nje ya Twitter ili kuunganisha vyanzo mbalimbali ambavyo vitafanya huduma yetu kuwa bora kwa watu wote. Kama mojawapo ya hatua katika kutimiza hilo, tunashirikiana na asasi mbalimbali ili kuongeza uwezo wa kupata taarifa za kuaminika wakati wa uchaguzi wa Kenya. Kukuza Taarifa za Kuaminika:Mmojawapo wa washirika wetu wa namna hiyo niAfrica Check; asasi iliyoanzishwa mwaka 2012 ikiwa ni asasi ya kwanza inayojitegemea, asasi inayozingatia ukweli pasipo kuegemea upande wowote ikipunguza ukali wa kauli hatarishi, na kuwawezesha watu kujihusisha na habari kwa umakinifu, na kujenga utamaduni wa kuangalia ukweli kote barani Afrika. Kuelekea kwenye Uchaguzi wa Kenya, Africa Check - ambayo ni sehemu yaFumbua, inaendelea kupambana na simulizi za uongo, kukuza taarifa ambazo ni sahihi na kuwa mstari wa mbele katika ketekeleza kazi muhimu ya kutoa elimu inayofanywa na vyombo vya habari katika ukanda wote. “Tunafurahi kushirikiana na Twitter kama sehemu ya kazi yetu katika uchaguzi nchiniKenya. Ushirikiano huu utatuwezesha kutatua changamoto ya taarifa potofu kwa kuhakiki ukweli wa madai na kutambua uwezekano wa uwepo wa taarifa potofu. Pia, tukielekea kwenye uchaguzi, kwenye jukwaa hili tutaonyesha taarifa ambazo ni sahihi, zilizothibitishwa ili wapiga kura waweze kufanya maamuzi wakiwa na uelewa. Programu za mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari ni mkakati makini unaolenga kupambana na taarifa potofu na kutuwezesha kutumia kazi yetu ya kuhakiki ukweli ili kuwalinda watu dhidi ya taarifa potofu na kuwapatia uwezo wa kuelewa, kuchambua, na kutathmini taarifa kwa umakini badala ya kupokea na kusambaza kila taarifa. Tunaamini kwamba hili linawafanya wafanye maamuzi yanayozingatia ushahidi tunapoelekea kwenye uchaguzi. Kwa hakika, ushirikiano na Twitter utaongeza matokeo ya mradi wetu wa mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari kwani unatuwezesha kufikia hadhira kubwa zaidi.”-  Afrika Check Kazi hii ni msingi wa kulinda mazungumzo yanayohusu uchaguzi na tunatarajia kuendelea kushirikiana na kufanya kazi pamoja na Africa Check na asasi zingine tunazoshirikiana nazo, mpaka kuisha kwa uchaguzi na hata baada ya uchaguzi. Uthibitishaji Katika kipindi cha kuelekea Uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022, Twitter imefanya kazi kwa kushirikiana na asasi za Kenya katika kuthibitisha akaunti za Mashirika ya Serikali, Wagombea, Vyama vya Siasa, Asasi za Kiraia (NGOs), Mashirika ya Habari, asasi na watengeneza maudhui. Beji ya Bluu ya Imethibititishwa kwenye Twitter inawafanya watu watambue kuwa akaunti yenye maslahi kwa umma ni ya kweli na hakika - hivyo kuwapa watu waliopo kwenye mtandao wa Twitter muktadha zaidi kuhusu ni akina nani wanazungumza nao ili waweze kubainisha jinsi wanavyojihusisha na akaunti fulani. Kukuza Taarifa za Kuaminika Timu zetu zinafanya kazi kuhakikisha kwamba wapiga kura wa Kenya wanaelekezwa kwenye taarifa sahihi wanapotumia muda wao kwenye jukwaa letu. Ili kuendana na juhudi zetu za kukuza taarifa sahihi, tumeweza kuzindua vipengele vifuatavyo: Utekelezaji wa sera Mbali na kutekeleza Sera zetu kuhusuMienendo ya Chuki na Tabia za Matusi,tumetekelezaSera ya Uadilifu wa Raiailiyo wazi ili watu wasiweze kutumia huduma za Twitter kwa madhumuni ya kudanganya au kuingilia uchaguzi au michakato mingine ya kiraia. Sera hasa inalenga moja kwa moja aina ya maudhui ambayo ni hatarishi, kama vile (haikomei kwenye) taarifa inayopotosha kuhusu jinsi ya kushiriki kwenye uchaguzi au taarifa inayopotosha ikilenga kutisha au kukatisha tamaa watu wasishiriki kwenye uchaguzi. Kuweka lebo: Ili kuendana na sera hii, tutaweka lebo kwenye Tweets ambazo zinahusisha taarifa za uongo au zinazopotosha ambazo zinapunguza imani ya watu juu ya uchaguzi au taarifa za uongo au zinazopotosha zinazoweza kuathiri matokeo ya uchaguzi. Tweet ambazo zimewekwa chini ya sera hii zitapunguzwa uwezo wa kuonwa na watu (kutokuzwa) kwenye jukwaa letu na zitaleta Matukio kwenye Twitter yenye maudhui yenye taarifa muhimu kuhusu mada hiyo - kwa kuzingatia vyanzo rasmi, vinavyoaminika na wahikiki taarifa. Ushiriki wa ndani Timu yetu ya sera ya Kusini mwa Jangwa la Sahara pia imetoa mafunzo ya usalama na ulinzi kwa asasi tunazoshirikiana nazo, kupitia vitendea kazi kama nyamazisha, funga na toa ripoti, na pia vidokezo tofauti vya usalama na mbinu kama vile uthibitisho wa njia mbili. Timu ya Kenya ya uchaguzi mkuu wa 2022 iliyoanzishwa katika mtandao wa Twitter, itafanya kazi kulinda uadilifu wa mazungumzo yanayohusiana na uchaguzi, kuunga mkono vikundi vya washirika na wawakilishi wa kisiasa pamoja na kutambua na kuzuia tishio lolote la uadilifu wa mazungumzo ya uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022 kwenye Twitter. Tumejitolea kutoa huduma ambayo inakuza na kuwezesha mijadala ya kisiasa na tutaendelea kuimarisha mojawapo ya kipaumbele chetu cha msingi, ambacho ni kulinda mazungumzo ya kisiasa na ya kiraia kwenye Twitter kupitia sera zetu, bidhaa zetu na ushirika muhimu tulionao duniani kote.

Ushirikiano huu utatuwezesha kutatua changamoto ya taarifa potofu kwa kuhakiki ukweli wa madai na kutambua uwezekano wa uwepo wa taarifa potofu. Pia, tukielekea kwenye uchaguzi, kwenye jukwaa hili tutaonyesha taarifa ambazo ni sahihi, zilizothibitishwa ili wapiga kura waweze kufanya maamuzi wakiwa na uelewa. Programu za mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari ni mkakati makini unaolenga kupambana na taarifa potofu na kutuwezesha kutumia kazi yetu ya kuhakiki ukweli ili kuwalinda watu dhidi ya taarifa potofu na kuwapatia uwezo wa kuelewa, kuchambua, na kutathmini taarifa kwa umakini badala ya kupokea na kusambaza kila taarifa. Tunaamini kwamba hili linawafanya wafanye maamuzi yanayozingatia ushahidi tunapoelekea kwenye uchaguzi. Kwa hakika, ushirikiano na Twitter utaongeza matokeo ya mradi wetu wa mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari kwani unatuwezesha kufikia hadhira kubwa zaidi.”-  Afrika Check Kazi hii ni msingi wa kulinda mazungumzo yanayohusu uchaguzi na tunatarajia kuendelea kushirikiana na kufanya kazi pamoja na Africa Check na asasi zingine tunazoshirikiana nazo, mpaka kuisha kwa uchaguzi na hata baada ya uchaguzi. Uthibitishaji Katika kipindi cha kuelekea Uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022, Twitter imefanya kazi kwa kushirikiana na asasi za Kenya katika kuthibitisha akaunti za Mashirika ya Serikali, Wagombea, Vyama vya Siasa, Asasi za Kiraia (NGOs), Mashirika ya Habari, asasi na watengeneza maudhui. Beji ya Bluu ya Imethibititishwa kwenye Twitter inawafanya watu watambue kuwa akaunti yenye maslahi kwa umma ni ya kweli na hakika - hivyo kuwapa watu waliopo kwenye mtandao wa Twitter muktadha zaidi kuhusu ni akina nani wanazungumza nao ili waweze kubainisha jinsi wanavyojihusisha na akaunti fulani. Kukuza Taarifa za Kuaminika Timu zetu zinafanya kazi kuhakikisha kwamba wapiga kura wa Kenya wanaelekezwa kwenye taarifa sahihi wanapotumia muda wao kwenye jukwaa letu. Ili kuendana na juhudi zetu za kukuza taarifa sahihi, tumeweza kuzindua vipengele vifuatavyo: Utekelezaji wa sera Mbali na kutekeleza Sera zetu kuhusuMienendo ya Chuki na Tabia za Matusi,tumetekelezaSera ya Uadilifu wa Raiailiyo wazi ili watu wasiweze kutumia huduma za Twitter kwa madhumuni ya kudanganya au kuingilia uchaguzi au michakato mingine ya kiraia. Sera hasa inalenga moja kwa moja aina ya maudhui ambayo ni hatarishi, kama vile (haikomei kwenye) taarifa inayopotosha kuhusu jinsi ya kushiriki kwenye uchaguzi au taarifa inayopotosha ikilenga kutisha au kukatisha tamaa watu wasishiriki kwenye uchaguzi. Kuweka lebo: Ili kuendana na sera hii, tutaweka lebo kwenye Tweets ambazo zinahusisha taarifa za uongo au zinazopotosha ambazo zinapunguza imani ya watu juu ya uchaguzi au taarifa za uongo au zinazopotosha zinazoweza kuathiri matokeo ya uchaguzi. Tweet ambazo zimewekwa chini ya sera hii zitapunguzwa uwezo wa kuonwa na watu (kutokuzwa) kwenye jukwaa letu na zitaleta Matukio kwenye Twitter yenye maudhui yenye taarifa muhimu kuhusu mada hiyo - kwa kuzingatia vyanzo rasmi, vinavyoaminika na wahikiki taarifa. Ushiriki wa ndani Timu yetu ya sera ya Kusini mwa Jangwa la Sahara pia imetoa mafunzo ya usalama na ulinzi kwa asasi tunazoshirikiana nazo, kupitia vitendea kazi kama nyamazisha, funga na toa ripoti, na pia vidokezo tofauti vya usalama na mbinu kama vile uthibitisho wa njia mbili. Timu ya Kenya ya uchaguzi mkuu wa 2022 iliyoanzishwa katika mtandao wa Twitter, itafanya kazi kulinda uadilifu wa mazungumzo yanayohusiana na uchaguzi, kuunga mkono vikundi vya washirika na wawakilishi wa kisiasa pamoja na kutambua na kuzuia tishio lolote la uadilifu wa mazungumzo ya uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022 kwenye Twitter. Tumejitolea kutoa huduma ambayo inakuza na kuwezesha mijadala ya kisiasa na tutaendelea kuimarisha mojawapo ya kipaumbele chetu cha msingi, ambacho ni kulinda mazungumzo ya kisiasa na ya kiraia kwenye Twitter kupitia sera zetu, bidhaa zetu na ushirika muhimu tulionao duniani kote.

"AtTwitter 2.0, we believe that we have a responsibility, as the town square of the internet, to make our platform transparent. So today we are taking the first step in a new era of transparency and opening much of our source code to the global community. OnGitHub, you’ll find two new repositories (main repo,ml repo) containing the source code for many parts of Twitter, including our recommendations algorithm, which controls the Tweets you see on the For You timeline. We’re also sharing more information on our recommendation algorithm inthis poston our Engineering Blog. For this release, we aimed for the highest possible degree of transparency, while excluding any code that would compromise user safety and privacy or the ability to protect our platform from bad actors, including undermining our efforts at combating child sexual exploitation and manipulation. Today’s release also does not include the code that powers our ad recommendations. We also took additional steps to ensure that user safety and privacy would be protected, including our decision not to release training data or model weights associated with the Twitter algorithm at this point. Ultimately, this is our first step to be more transparent in this way, and we plan to continue sharing more code that does not present a significant risk to Twitter or people on our platform. We invite the community to submit GitHub issues and pull requests for suggestions on improving the recommendations algorithm. We are working on tools to manage these suggestions and sync changes to our internal repository. Any security concerns or issues should be routed to our officialbug bounty programthrough HackerOne. We hope to benefit from the collective intelligence and expertise of the global community in helping us identify issues and suggest improvements, ultimately leading to a better Twitter.

"Keeping people safe and secure on Twitter is one of our top priorities, and we’re committed to helping people understand the security tools we offer and how to use them. Starting today, people on Twitter have the option to use security keys as their only form of two-factor authentication (2FA), which is the most effective way to keep your Twitter account secure. While any form of 2FA is better than no 2FA, physical security keys are the most effective. Security keys are small devices that act like keys to your house. Just as you need a physical key to unlock the door to your home, you need a security key to unlock access to your account. Security keys offer the strongest protection for your Twitter account because they have built-in protections to ensure that even if a key is used on a phishing site, the information shared can’t be used to access your account. They use theFIDOandWebAuthnsecurity standards to transfer the burden of protecting against phishing attempts from a human to a hardware device. Security keys can differentiate legitimate sites from malicious ones and block phishing attempts that SMS or verification codes would not. Twitter has long encouraged the use ofsome form of 2FA. In 2018, we added the option to use security keys as one of several 2FA options. However, this initial support only worked for Twitter.com, not the mobile app, and required accounts to have another form of 2FA enabled as well. In 2019, weupgraded our security key supportto use the latest WebAuthn standard, which provides an up-to-date and secure authentication method recognized across the web. We also enabled the ability to use 2FA on a Twitter accountwithout requiring a phone number, allowing people to protect their accounts from SIM-swapping attacks and opening up 2FA to more people. In 2020, we made additional improvements by enabling support forsecurity keys on iOS and Android, in addition to the web. And earlier this year, we added the ability to registermultiple security keyson your Twitter account, allowing you to have backup security keys and making it easier for accounts managed by multiple people to enable 2FA with multiple security keys. Today, we’re adding the option to use security keys as your sole 2FA method — meaning you can enroll one or more security keys as the only form of 2FA on your Twitter account without a backup 2FA method. We know this is important to people because not everyone is able to have a backup 2FA method or wants to share their phone number with us. With this update, we want everyone to feel empowered toenable security keysto better secure their Twitter account.

"Twitter is always working to make it easier for you to discover the conversations and accounts that interest you the most. Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter. Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a wholeHelp Center articledetailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read). If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them. The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals. Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter. Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic. Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. One of these options is the “sparkle icon”  ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top ""For You"" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and ""Latest"" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content. Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re alsotesting new waysto clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t. With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see.

"As more and more people are enjoying opened golf courses right now, we want to share some learnings from the Twitter Data Partner Cup that we hosted last fall. The format was a 'shotgun scramble' golf tournament in Los Angeles, CA meant to celebrate a few ofTwitter’s Data partnersand their customers for a day of fun on the links. If you are unfamiliar with the scramble format, each member of a four-person team tees off and the team repeatedly picks the best shot until the hole is completed. With a 'shotgun' start, there are 18 teams that begin play simultaneously – each starting on a different hole. For example, team 8 starts on hole 8. With most non-professional golf tournaments, the team scores are typically not known until the very end when the scorecards are turned in. How cool would it be to get real-time score updates during the game? We saw this as an opportunity to create a tool that would allow for a live scoring system. This system could enable teams to submit their scores from the course as holes are completed, and the compiled scores could be shared via a live leaderboard, helping to fuel the competition. As members of the Twitter Developer Relations team, we felt up for the challenge to build such a scoring system with the Twitter platform. We began prototyping a solution during a company hackweek. We first sketched out a technical design for a system where: It became clear that we'd be building aTwitter chatbot, where private messages (Direct Messages) provide the main communication channel, while also having the ability to communicate with public Tweets. When we thought about the features we'd want for such an app, these surfaced as the main features: With these design goals in mind, we began to build with the following Twitter API endpoints, which provide the foundation for any Twitter chatbot: Even though we were testing and debugging up until the night before the event (like any hackweek project), we are happy to report the leaderboard app worked nearly flawlessly. The ability to see how other teams were scoring added to the excitement as the event progressed. Seeing notifications of other team's subpar holes added to the ""what's happening now?"" experience. The main day-of-show challenge was spotty cell coverage out on the course. It's definitely recommended to test coverage at the event location beforehand. Also, in some cases, there clearly was not enough training on how to submit scores correctly the first time (we will not name names). Finally, we built the app to Tweet only when teams scored a Birdie (one under par). While Eagles (two under par) were not expected, they happened several times and were not Tweeted about. More sadly, there was a hole-in-one that went completely unacknowledged in real-time. Next time, we’ll be sure to account for these rare events and notify the audience! Not into golf? That's OK. Keep in mind that the framework used here to support a live golf scoring system is general enough for other use cases. This design could be used for a variety of other scenarios like scavenger hunts and other sports tournaments, such as soccer and bowling. Beyond shared sporting events, these patterns can support private polls by receiving private votes and rankings and publicly sharing compiled results at their completion. The next time you’re planning a tournament or friendly game, think of Twitter. The @HackerScorer chatbot was developed in Python using Flask. See theproject's GitHub repositoryfor more details. If you want to learn more about how this live scoring app was developed and deployed, see our code-drivenblog postabout this prototype.

The format was a 'shotgun scramble' golf tournament in Los Angeles, CA meant to celebrate a few ofTwitter’s Data partnersand their customers for a day of fun on the links. If you are unfamiliar with the scramble format, each member of a four-person team tees off and the team repeatedly picks the best shot until the hole is completed. With a 'shotgun' start, there are 18 teams that begin play simultaneously – each starting on a different hole. For example, team 8 starts on hole 8. With most non-professional golf tournaments, the team scores are typically not known until the very end when the scorecards are turned in. How cool would it be to get real-time score updates during the game? We saw this as an opportunity to create a tool that would allow for a live scoring system.

"At this point in 2021, we know there is no going back to the way things were before the pandemic. While companies reevaluate office reopenings and new ways of working, countries continue to deal with the soaring COVID-19 cases and challenges associated with vaccine access and uptake. This year is a solid reminder that our approach to what’s ahead requires a new way of thinking. At Twitter, we’ve made strides. We’ve become a more distributed, more global Tweepforce, putting our Tweeps in the center and prioritizing flexibility and choice in how we work. We also recognize that it’s more complex than this, and collectively we’ve got work to do to build a truly inclusive culture. Looking at our 2025 vision, we’re proud of the increases in women globally and Black and Latinx U.S. representation this quarter. View our latest numberson our Careers site. While attracting and retaining talent is a top priority, we know this work takes more than any one initiative or company –– it takes all of us. At Twitter, we take a multifaceted approach that embeds our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) principles across all aspects of the business. Today, I want to share, in closer detail, three important pillars driving progress across Twitter: Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement, Supplier Diversity, and Diversifying Corporate Development Investments & Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A). Initially kicking off in the US, we’re excited to expand many of these initiatives around the world in the future. Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement Earlier this year, we introduced#TwitterIgnite, a program from our Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement (DPS) team to elevate diverse communities and ignite change. We started by engaging partners from civil rights organizations, Historically Black Colleges, Non-Governmental Organizations, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council, with three objectives in mind: And while we’re proud of our initiatives in the US, we also acknowledge the need to expand our reach. This year, we’ve started with an initial focus on our EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). We are currently developing our strategy for three target markets (the UK, Ireland, and Ghana) as we continue to expand the #TwitterIgnite program globally. Supplier Diversity In 2019, Twitter established our Supplier Inclusion & Diversity (SI&D) program to leverage the power of Twitter to drive equity and inclusion in our supplier identification, selection, and purchasing processes. While we have only recently started our SI&D program, over the last two years, we have made significant progress in setting the foundation with our US Suppliers for what we eventually intend to be a global and industry-leading program. Some of our key milestones include enabling suppliers to self-identify diverse ownership classification as part of our onboarding process, developing spend reporting capabilities, and nurturing well-established relationships with key community organizations that support our ability to achieve our goals. We have also begun to engage our suppliers by launching an I&D Supplier Survey to understand better our suppliers’ commitment to the workplace, workforce, and supplier diversity. Each of these initiatives help us lay a foundation to increase investments across underrepresented communities, create spend-equity, increase the utilization of the Twitter platform, and practice transparency by externally sharing our progress and plans. Building on our foundation this year, we're proud to have implemented a number of initiatives at Twitter, such as introducing diverse spend goals by team, quarterly spend reporting, and connecting suppliers to our teams through monthly showcases. By attending these showcases, suppliers learn about our supplier needs and how to leverage Twitter’s service to benefit their business. So far, we have seen an increase in SI&D spend of over 65% compared to 2020, and our supplier sessions have connected with over 150 potential suppliers that we can consider for future opportunities. Looking forward, by 2025, we intend to: The work will be intensive, complex, and sometimes disruptive. Still, it will give Twitter the ability to deliver an even greater impact on and benefit from the power of these communities of suppliers. Diversifying Corporate Development Investments & Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Our Corporate Development & Strategy Team (Corp Dev) team plays an important role in helping the company reach its 2025 Tweepforce representationtargets. It also acts as a force multiplier to invest in women, Black, and Latinx founders. Developing these relationships and diversifying our M&A pipeline not only helps accelerate our diverse workforce representation progress, but it also serves as a model for other companies that wish to engage in this critical work. In early discussions about a potential acquisition, companies and their founders share more about their strategies and practices for building and nurturing diverse talent and teams. We also incorporate diverse interview panels within Twitter (aiming for two out of three interviewers to be women, Black, and/or Latinx) as part of our vetting progress. When reviewing the opportunity, our leadership reviews the data to evaluate if the target company would further progress our Tweepforce representation goals.These practices bring explicit awareness to the impact on I&D commitments of the teams we vet and onboard as potential acquisition targets. This year Corp Dev invested in women, Black, and Latinx founder-led companies and funds that support historically excluded communities. Before making these investments, Corp Dev will meet with early-stage venture funds with the specific mission of investing in historically excluded communities and women founders. Ultimately, these meetings will improve the diversity of our startup pipeline and provide visibility into other communities with whom we’ve yet to engage. As of June 30, our team met with 65+ funds to help them understand our objectives, learn about how they support the communities we seek to invest in, get their feedback on our thinking, and identify areas and startups that overlap with Twitter focus areas. In May, we announced our first investments to three venture capital funds: In July we announced three additional fund investments: Continuing Our Journey Our multifaceted approach will help us continue to hold ourselves accountable against our I&D goals while leveraging the power of Twitter to expand our impact. While there have been nonstop curveballs since announcing our bold 2025 goals back in January 2020, we continue to prioritize staying on course to make Twitter the most inclusive, diverse, and accessible tech company.

"We all have — or will — face a moment when we hear news about a difficult medical diagnosis, either for ourselves or a loved one.

The first impulse is often to try and absorb as much information as possible to make sense of what it all means.

We have spent a lot of time at YouTube trying to better understand why people come to our platform when they have health questions.

Some of what we found isn’t surprising – people visit YouTube when they want to understand something complex in simple, visual terms.

Human biology is complicated and video can make it easier.

YouTube creators are seen as down to earth messengers who explain things in an accessible way that people understand.

But we also saw another pattern in the data.

Many times, people aren’t coming to YouTube with a health question at all.

Instead, they come with a human question: how do I live with this? People grappling with the reality of living with a health condition, especially a chronic one, were not looking for information.

They were looking for support.

How did other people live with this? Does it ever get better? How do I support my loved one through this? What meaning can I make of it? And they were all getting at the same human element: we help each other get through things.

The need for connection and belonging is a universal one, and that’s proven with data – the science of peer support shows that social connectedness positively impacts both physical and mental health.

Today, we’re launching a new way to do just that, with the introduction of our new Personal Stories shelf .

Starting this week, when you search for health topics and questions related to certain conditions, you’ll see a shelf showing videos of personal stories relevant to the topic.

To start, we are focusing on queries related to cancer, and mental health topics like anxiety and depression, but these topic areas will expand over the coming months.

The Personal Stories shelf will be available for users in the US, but we plan to expand this feature to more markets around the world.

To be eligible for the shelf, videos must primarily focus on a personal, authentic lived experience that is relevant to a specific physical or mental health condition.

Content that is promotional in nature is not eligible for this feature, and all videos that appear in this feature must comply with our policies that prevent the spread of health misinformation.

This work was deeply influenced and informed by the personal experiences of all of us on the YouTube Health team, but none more so than our colleague Maya Amoils.

During an interview on the All the Wiser podcast, Maya shared that after her diagnosis, she sought insights from people who had walked in her shoes: “I wanted to learn from people who had sat in the unknown and learned to live with it.” Maya was in her late 20s when she was diagnosed with stage-4 ovarian cancer.

She spoke both publicly and privately about the experience of that diagnosis, and the daily ins and outs of living with cancer.

After her diagnosis, Maya found herself seeking connection with other young women who were going through a similar experience.

She helped our YouTube Health team understand the need for people to have shared human experience to complement information – to connect and know that you’re not alone.

That’s why, in addition to her role as the Mental Health partnership lead, Maya was also our product consultant and helped guide our work to better define, algorithmically identify, and showcase people’s personal health stories on YouTube.

She helped us to center the perspectives of people who were dealing with the human experience of illness through her own superpower – an uncanny ability to connect easily and deeply with everyone who met her.

We lost our dear friend Maya this past January.

She leaves behind a legacy of giving not only through this project, but through Maya’s Way , her foundation that supports women under age 40 who are undergoing cancer care to access integrative medicine as a support to their treatment, and helps them to live with optimal wellbeing despite their illness.

In the months since Maya passed, we have been thinking about how to honor her and her work on this project.

It is difficult to articulate how much we miss Maya.

But sharing her story and the ways that she impacted all of us who were so fortunate to know and work with her is one way that we can demonstrate all that we learned from her.

She has made an impact that will live on through all of the YouTube creators, patients and caregivers who find connection and support in difficult times.

Reflected in this new line-up, YouTube Originals Kids & Family has developed content goals in collaboration with experts across the globe in areas related to child safety, child development, and digital literacy — focused on producing shows that inspire kids’ learning and discovery of their unique strengths and passions while finding their own voice.

A heartless artificially intelligent ruler, Tobor meets his match in Sema, who knows that with determination, creativity, and a helping hand from the amazing worlds of science and technology, anything is possible.

“Super Sema” was written by four-time BAFTA winner Claudia Lloyd (“Charlie & Lola,” “Mr.

Bean,” “Tinga Tinga Tales”) and directed by Lynne Southerland, the first female African-American director for Disney (“Mulan II”).

"Over the past few weeks, we have mourned the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade — and the other known and unknown victims of racial terror and violence.

These killings occurred against the backdrop of a global pandemic that disproportionately ravaged the Black community and surfaced entrenched racial inequities.

In our anguish, we have taken to the streets in protest — in every state and around the globe — to demand the dismantling of systemic racism in society.

"The video landscape today is rapidly changing in ways that are redefining how we watch, what we watch, and why we watch—developments that impact not just viewers, but also advertisers, creators, and artists.

And while some of these trends have been years in the making, the pandemic dramatically accelerated their evolution in our lives.

Earlier this morning, I participated in IAB’s annual leadership meeting to talk about three trends driving digital video into the future.

Streaming platforms and CTV are on the rise Even before the pandemic, streaming was quickly becoming the preferred way to enjoy content.

The last year solidified this trend, with increasing numbers of people abandoning traditional linear TV.

According to eMarketer , more than 106 million U.S.

households are projected to watch streaming content in 2021, eclipsing pay TV.

Viewers are leaving behind traditional primetime, and we’re finding at YouTube that the new primetime is personal.

People want the freedom to stream anything whenever they want, whether it’s a favorite movie, a hard-to-find music performance, a premiere sports event, or even a tough workout.

Viewers are also increasingly streaming content on their connected TV screens as they spend more time at home.

In fact, though mobile still makes up the largest percentage of how content is consumed on the platform, our fastest growing viewing experience is on the TV screen.

Last December, over 120 million people in the U.S.

streamed YouTube or YouTube TV on their TV screens.

And there’s another interesting viewing behavior emerging.

A new generation of viewers chooses to watch YouTube primarily on the TV screen: Also in December, over a quarter of logged-in YouTube CTV viewers in the U.S.

watched content almost exclusively on the TV screen.

1 For advertisers, the move to streaming on TV screens brings both challenges and opportunities.

Some challenges, like planning what to buy and measuring impact, aren’t exactly new.

Solutions are being developed to address these issues and have already broken new ground.

For example, for the first time ever this 2021/2022 upfront season in the U.S., advertisers will be able to measure their YouTube CTV campaigns with Nielsen.

As for opportunities, streaming gives advertisers more places to reach those customers who have been abandoning TV for streaming platforms, including hard-to-reach viewers.

And while much has been made about the complexity and fragmentation of audiences, the number of ad-supported platforms with scale is actually pretty small.

According to Comscore , 82.5 percent of CTV reach in the U.S.

falls on only five streaming services: Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+, but only two sell ads.

41 percent of all ad-supported streaming watch time in the U.S.

happens on YouTube.

2 All of this makes clear how CTV has opened a significant new chapter for video on YouTube and beyond.

E-commerce is growing faster, powered by digital video It’s no secret that e-commerce has been growing for years, but the pandemic further fueled its jump last year.

In 2020, online shopping’s share of total retail sales hit 21.3%, a 44% spike from the previous year.

3 And as this shift only continues to grow, video will play an increasingly important role.

One reason is that consumers want the convenience of researching and reviewing products online at home, but with the trusted guidance of an in-store experience.

That’s where YouTube’s creators come in.

They’ve committed considerable time and effort into building authentic connections with fans, and as a result, deliver trusted brand and product recommendations to their audience.

Just look at iJustine , who vlogs about virtually all tech gear - from mobile phones to consumer drones - and gives expert reviews her fans have come to depend on.

Not surprisingly, according to a study we partnered with Talkshoppe on in 2020, 70% of YouTube viewers say they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube.

In my recent blog post launching this innovation series, I discussed how we’re beta testing a new integrated shopping experience that lets viewers tap into the credibility and knowledge of creators to make informed purchases directly on YouTube.

Short-form content is here for the long run The growth of short-form content on mobile has been remarkable to watch and it can be explained by two related developments: easy paths to creation and consumption.

Mobile devices offer simple but powerful tools for anyone to create or watch compelling content.

To give viewers the short-form content they’ve grown to love, we’ve been developing our own short-form mobile experience called “Shorts.” We began beta testing Shorts last year in India with various creation tools, including a multi-segment camera, the ability to record with music, speed controls, as well as a timer and countdown feature.

Since the beginning of December, the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled.

In the next few weeks, we’ll begin expanding the beta to the U.S.

As these three trends lay out, it’s an exciting time for digital video.

Video empowers viewers to watch content as never before; advertisers to reach customers as never before; and creators and artists to find an audience as never before.

CTV, e-commerce, and short-form video will continue to play out in the years ahead, and I’m looking forward to seeing what new trends redefine the place of video in our lives.

2020, U.S.

According to one review of U.S.

Department of Commerce data for 2020.",,,,3 trends that are redefining video,20210310,,,,en-en,"products and features, executives",en,India,,,"The video landscape today is rapidly changing in ways that are redefining how we watch, what we watch, and why we watch—developments that impact not just viewers, but also advertisers, creators, and artists.

And while some of these trends have been years in the making, the pandemic dramatically accelerated their evolution in our lives.

Earlier this morning, I participated in IAB’s annual leadership meeting to talk about three trends driving digital video into the future.

Streaming platforms and CTV are on the rise Even before the pandemic, streaming was quickly becoming the preferred way to enjoy content.

The last year solidified this trend, with increasing numbers of people abandoning traditional linear TV.

According to eMarketer , more than 106 million U.S.

households are projected to watch streaming content in 2021, eclipsing pay TV.

Viewers are leaving behind traditional primetime, and we’re finding at YouTube that the new primetime is personal.

People want the freedom to stream anything whenever they want, whether it’s a favorite movie, a hard-to-find music performance, a premiere sports event, or even a tough workout.

Viewers are also increasingly streaming content on their connected TV screens as they spend more time at home.

In fact, though mobile still makes up the largest percentage of how content is consumed on the platform, our fastest growing viewing experience is on the TV screen.

Last December, over 120 million people in the U.S.

streamed YouTube or YouTube TV on their TV screens.

And there’s another interesting viewing behavior emerging.

A new generation of viewers chooses to watch YouTube primarily on the TV screen: Also in December, over a quarter of logged-in YouTube CTV viewers in the U.S.

watched content almost exclusively on the TV screen.

1 For advertisers, the move to streaming on TV screens brings both challenges and opportunities.

Some challenges, like planning what to buy and measuring impact, aren’t exactly new.

Solutions are being developed to address these issues and have already broken new ground.

For example, for the first time ever this 2021/2022 upfront season in the U.S., advertisers will be able to measure their YouTube CTV campaigns with Nielsen.

As for opportunities, streaming gives advertisers more places to reach those customers who have been abandoning TV for streaming platforms, including hard-to-reach viewers.

And while much has been made about the complexity and fragmentation of audiences, the number of ad-supported platforms with scale is actually pretty small.

According to Comscore , 82.5 percent of CTV reach in the U.S.

falls on only five streaming services: Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+, but only two sell ads.

41 percent of all ad-supported streaming watch time in the U.S.

"Before the pandemic, Dublin-based Googler Khalid Soleja hadn’t picked up a paintbrush in more than a decade.

He loved painting and taking art classes as a teenager, but the hobby had since been replaced by work and new activities.

That is, until a few months ago when he came across a tutorial on YouTube .

“It inspired me to pick up the brush after many years,” Khalid says.

“I also wanted to make sure I purchased my materials from my local art shop which had been suffering due to many closures and restrictions.” Khalid, a program manager who works on Google Cloud, is an avid traveler who loves exploring new places.

Since that’s not possible right now, he instead decided to paint his favorite travel destination: Rio de Janeiro.

In his piece, he incorporated some of the famous landmarks he saw when he visited, including the Carioca Aqueduct and the Selaron Steps Khalid and his grandmother working on the Rio de Janeiro painting together.

“Painting feels great because it allows me to take time away from screens and always being on the internet.

I like to paint on really large canvases and get my family to join in too,” Khalid says.

“I was really excited to be able to get my grandma involved who had never used a paintbrush before in her life! It helped us pass the time while isolating together at my family home in London.” He’s also been experimenting with abstract art, and watched YouTube tutorials to learn how to create paintings using palette knives for the first time.

Palette knives are blunt tools made from thin steel blades in a range of sizes.

They’re primarily used to mix or apply paint, but you can also use them in place of paintbrushes.

“I’ve been able to create some unique pieces with this process,” he says.

“It’s been awesome to use YouTube as a tool to quickly learn new skills from so many talented content creators.” Geometric Art - October 2020 - Acrylic on Canvas Khalid’s YouTube channel recommendations for painters: One of his favorites is Suraj Fine Arts , which Khalid says is perfect for beginners.

"This week marks the start of Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday known as the Festival of Lights.

It’s a time of celebration and coming together.

With antisemitism on the rise both in the United States and around the world, YouTube and Google are joining with the Anti-Defamation League as they shine a light on this concerning increase in hatred and violence, as part of our ongoing commitment to combating antisemitism both online and offline.

That commitment finds many forms, from fighting hate speech online to financial support for educational and human rights organizations.

We also fund the creation of original content on YouTube that helps to further racial justice and religious tolerance, and are proud to announce that the next installment of our YouTube Originals series “ Recipe for Change ” will premiere in Spring 2022.

The series is produced by LeBron James' The SpringHill Company and will bring together Jewish creators, authors, actors, and activists.

The focus of conversation is antisemitism in the U.S.

as well as a celebration of Jewish food and culture.

Jonathan A.

Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League To learn more about the Shine A Light campaign, YouTube’s Global Head of Human Rights Partnerships, Malika Saada Saar, spoke to Jonathan A.

Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

Can you share with us what the ADL does and how it is part of a larger network of organizations addressing hate? For more than a century, ADL has worked to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.

As part of that, we’ve built a world-class team investigating extremist threats, an evil that has intensified and expanded in recent years with devastating consequences.

We work closely with a number of civil and human rights organizations representing marginalized communities, among them NAACP, LULAC, the Committee of 100, GLAAD, The Asian American Foundation, the National Urban League, and many others, to coordinate our efforts to fight antisemitism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ bias, hate crimes, bigotry, and discrimination.

We also work in close coordination with many Jewish organizations to ensure that we are securing the safety and well-being of all Jewish people in communities across the U.S.

Over the past year we have seen a rise in antisemitism and antisemitic violence in the U.S.

and around the world.

What has the ADL been tracking, and can you give us a sense of the scope of this current challenge? Antisemitism is one of the oldest and most persistent forms of hatred.

It is the proverbial canary in the coal mine, serving as a warning that other prejudices in society inevitably are not far behind when antisemitism is present.

And hate is not unique to the Jewish people.

As the attacks in Christchurch and Halle have demonstrated, white supremacy is a global terror threat that can explode into violence against Jews and other marginalized groups.

ADL focuses most of its attention on the U.S.

and the trends here are worrisome.

Indeed, the number of antisemitic incidents in America has surged in recent years.

According to ADL’s Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, 2019 was the worst year on record for attacks on Jews in America.

We tabulated 2,107 antisemitic incidents throughout the U.S., a 12 percent increase from the 1,879 incidents recorded in 2018.

Our researchers found that an additional 2,024 antisemitic incidents occurred throughout the U.S.

in 2020.

While this was a four percent decrease from 2019, it also was the third-highest year on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979.

In the face of unprecedented attacks on the Jewish community, last year ADL conducted a survey of Jewish Americans to explore their experiences with antisemitism.

It found that more than half (54 percent) of Jews in America have either experienced or witnessed some form of incident that they believed was motivated by antisemitism over the past five years.

Jews also commonly encounter antisemitism online.

One in seven experienced some form of harassment, and more than one in 10 have experienced a severe form of harassment such as being physically threatened as a result of their religion.

We’ve also seen an increase in antisemitism in Europe, both in terms of hate incidents and anti-Jewish attitudes.

As a result, more than one-third of European Jews have reportedly considered emigration because they do not feel safe in their own country.

This Hanukkah, you’ve launched a new campaign called Shine A Light.

Can you tell me a bit about this campaign and why you wanted to connect it with Hanukkah? In anticipation of Hanukkah, ADL has joined an unprecedented coalition of over 60 North American and Canadian Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and corporations to launch .

This national initiative will illuminate the dangers of antisemitism through education, community partnerships, workplace engagement, and advocacy.

Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a time of year when Jews celebrate the miracle of the recovery of Jerusalem and the rededication of the Second Temple during the time of the Maccabees.

We light candles for each of the eight nights of the holiday, and these lights, while symbolic of the oil that lasted for eight days and eight nights after the temple’s menorah was rekindled, also have come to symbolize hope for the future and of bringing light to the world.

Amid the widespread rise in antisemitism in North America, Shine A Light seeks to catalyze conversations within and across communities, on school campuses, and in the workplace, so that people will better understand what constitutes anti-Jewish hate and take steps to respond.

YouTube and Google recently pledged to the Malmö International Forum to promote education about the Holocaust and combat antisemitism both online and offline.

What are you seeing in terms of online discourse about the Holocaust and antisemitism, and does it present a different type of challenge to previous forms of denial and hate speech that took advantage of communication tools like radio? We were pleased by the commitments of YouTube, Google, and others in Malmö to promote Holocaust education and to combat antisemitism.

As we have said before, these companies and their peers in Silicon Valley need to do more, so these moves are a start.

They are important in terms of both preserving the memory of the six million Jews and millions of others who perished in the Holocaust and ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust and the imperative of “Never Again,” endures for future generations.

There are various strains of Holocaust trivialization and denial that remain troubling, both online and in the actual world.

Online denial concerns are a serious problem on platforms.

And in recent months we’ve continued to see abhorrent comparisons between government COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates and the Holocaust.

Such comparisons have no place in any political debate.

One symptom of these odious and false comparisons of vaccine mandates to the Nazis is that they play into the hands of Holocaust deniers, those who promote the antisemitic notion that the Holocaust didn’t really happen or was greatly distorted by historians — something we cannot afford to tolerate.

Research has shown that Holocaust denial is proliferating on social media.

Twenty-three percent of respondents in a recent study said they believed the Holocaust was a myth, or had been exaggerated, or they were not sure.

Nearly half reported seeing Holocaust denial or distortion posts online, and 30 percent had seen Nazi symbols on their social media platforms or in their communities.

We believe the best antidote to Holocaust denial and antisemitism is education.

That’s why ADL has supported legislation mandating Holocaust education in our public middle and high schools, and why we offer curriculum training and resources such as Echoes & Reflections , which we created in partnership with Yad Vashem and the USC Shoah Foundation .

Every year we train thousands of teachers to use this multimedia curriculum on the Holocaust.

Many companies are making significant commitments to addressing hate and harassment and seeking to be part of the work to make a fairer and more just world.

What can YouTube and other companies do to address and disrupt the surge of anti-Semitism, both online and offline? More so than perhaps any other industry, online platforms are well positioned to take meaningful actions to prevent the spread of hate.

Recently, ADL unveiled its REPAIR Plan , a comprehensive framework calling for reforms across the industry and in the laws governing the high-tech industry.

Some of the priorities we identified for industry include transparency about the functions and impacts of their algorithms; establishing and enforcing anti-hate policies at scale; putting more resources towards protecting victims and targets of online harassment; countering disinformation and improving content moderation; and incorporating an “anti-hate by design” approach in the development of their products and policies.

Thanks Jonathan, we appreciate the thoughtfulness that ADL has put into these recommendations, and YouTube has taken steps to ensure that promoting hateful ideologies like Naziism or denying the existence of well-documented violent events like the Holocaust have no place on our platform.

Effectively combating this challenge will require a whole-of-society approach – what actions can individuals take to help Shine A Light? How should allies show up in this moment? Here’s a list of recommended actions we will be promoting during the eight nights of Hanukkah.

We hope everyone will join us in helping to Shine A Light on antisemitism: Share how you #ShineALight on antisemitism on social media.

Learn more about some of the most pernicious antisemitic myths – and how to address them in Antisemitism Uncovered: A Guide to Old Myths in a New Era .",,,,"Shining a light on antisemitism, with the Anti-Defamation League",20211201,,,,en-en,events,en,United States,,,"This week marks the start of Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday known as the Festival of Lights.

It’s a time of celebration and coming together.

With antisemitism on the rise both in the United States and around the world, YouTube and Google are joining with the Anti-Defamation League as they shine a light on this concerning increase in hatred and violence, as part of our ongoing commitment to combating antisemitism both online and offline.

That commitment finds many forms, from fighting hate speech online to financial support for educational and human rights organizations.

We also fund the creation of original content on YouTube that helps to further racial justice and religious tolerance, and are proud to announce that the next installment of our YouTube Originals series “ Recipe for Change ” will premiere in Spring 2022.

The series is produced by LeBron James' The SpringHill Company and will bring together Jewish creators, authors, actors, and activists.

The focus of conversation is antisemitism in the U.S.

as well as a celebration of Jewish food and culture.

Jonathan A.

Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League To learn more about the Shine A Light campaign, YouTube’s Global Head of Human Rights Partnerships, Malika Saada Saar, spoke to Jonathan A.

Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

Can you share with us what the ADL does and how it is part of a larger network of organizations addressing hate? For more than a century, ADL has worked to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.

As part of that, we’ve built a world-class team investigating extremist threats, an evil that has intensified and expanded in recent years with devastating consequences.

We work closely with a number of civil and human rights organizations representing marginalized communities, among them NAACP, LULAC, the Committee of 100, GLAAD, The Asian American Foundation, the National Urban League, and many others, to coordinate our efforts to fight antisemitism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ bias, hate crimes, bigotry, and discrimination.

We also work in close coordination with many Jewish organizations to ensure that we are securing the safety and well-being of all Jewish people in communities across the U.S.

Over the past year we have seen a rise in antisemitism and antisemitic violence in the U.S.

and around the world.

What has the ADL been tracking, and can you give us a sense of the scope of this current challenge? Antisemitism is one of the oldest and most persistent forms of hatred.

It is the proverbial canary in the coal mine, serving as a warning that other prejudices in society inevitably are not far behind when antisemitism is present.

And hate is not unique to the Jewish people.

As the attacks in Christchurch and Halle have demonstrated, white supremacy is a global terror threat that can explode into violence against Jews and other marginalized groups.

ADL focuses most of its attention on the U.S.

and the trends here are worrisome.

Indeed, the number of antisemitic incidents in America has surged in recent years.

According to ADL’s Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, 2019 was the worst year on record for attacks on Jews in America.

We tabulated 2,107 antisemitic incidents throughout the U.S., a 12 percent increase from the 1,879 incidents recorded in 2018.

Our researchers found that an additional 2,024 antisemitic incidents occurred throughout the U.S.

in 2020.

While this was a four percent decrease from 2019, it also was the third-highest year on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979.

In the face of unprecedented attacks on the Jewish community, last year ADL conducted a survey of Jewish Americans to explore their experiences with antisemitism.

It found that more than half (54 percent) of Jews in America have either experienced or witnessed some form of incident that they believed was motivated by antisemitism over the past five years.

Jews also commonly encounter antisemitism online.

One in seven experienced some form of harassment, and more than one in 10 have experienced a severe form of harassment such as being physically threatened as a result of their religion.

We’ve also seen an increase in antisemitism in Europe, both in terms of hate incidents and anti-Jewish attitudes.

As a result, more than one-third of European Jews have reportedly considered emigration because they do not feel safe in their own country.

This Hanukkah, you’ve launched a new campaign called Shine A Light.

"The 2023 NFL season is fast approaching, and we couldn’t be more excited! From launching multiview on YouTube TV and now on YouTube, to enabling unlimited streams at home for NFL Sunday Ticket content, we’ve been busy bringing the best of what fans know and love about YouTube to the football experience.

Whether you’re planning to watch via YouTube or YouTube TV, here are 6 features that will be available over the next few weeks to make your Kickoff Weekend better than ever.

1.

Introduce more choice and control with monthly payment plans A big piece of feedback that we heard from you is for more flexible billing options for NFL Sunday Ticket.

Well, starting today, viewers in most states will start seeing a monthly payment plan option when signing up for NFL Sunday Ticket.

This will enable you to pay for your NFL Sunday Ticket subscription over time, versus all at once.

We will be rolling this out over the next week on both YouTube and YouTube TV, so hang tight if you don’t see it yet.

2.

Add the student plan to your back-to-school shopping list And speaking of more choices, we will be introducing student plans on YouTube for NFL Sunday Ticket within the next week.

For eligible students who love football, keep an eye out here to learn when and how to sign up.

Just in time for the new school year.

3.

Select from more multiview options Since launching early access in March, we’ve been refining the multiview experience so that all viewers, regardless of their TV device, are able to enjoy the feature.

During this upcoming NFL season, NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers will be able to choose from an extensive assortment of multiview combinations every Sunday afternoon.

If you signed up for the NFL Sunday Ticket + NFL RedZone package, your multiview options will include both out-of-market games and RedZone, whether you’re watching from YouTube or YouTube TV.

On YouTube TV, multiview combinations will also include local NFL games side-by-side with your NFL Sunday Ticket games.

And even if you’re a YouTube TV member without NFL Sunday Ticket, you can still enjoy using multiview to watch NFL games and college football this fall.

The more multiview, the merrier! 4.

Engage with live chat and polls Nothing makes game days better than being able to react to every first down, fumble and touchdown with other fans.

At the start of the season, viewers watching NFL Sunday Ticket games through YouTube will be able to enjoy live chat and polls on both their mobile and TV devices.

And soon, we’ll also add other features such as NFL Shop integrations to complement the viewing experience.

5.

Catch up with key plays on YouTube and YouTube TV We’re bringing a fan-favorite feature from YouTube TV — key plays — to YouTube.

With key plays, viewers will either be able to catch up on a game they missed or watch a quick snippet of each major play before jumping into the live game.

Key plays for YouTube will only be available on TVs this season.

6.

Jump into the action with real-time NFL highlights in YouTube Shorts NFL fans, get ready to see more NFL content on YouTube.

Starting this season, real-time highlights from every single NFL game will be available in the Shorts player, right as the action is happening.

Highlights that appear in viewers’ Shorts feeds on Sunday afternoon will include a red “Live” ring around the NFL channel avatar.

Clicking on the ring directs viewers seamlessly to the Live tab on the NFL channel, where subscribers can easily select which NFL Sunday Ticket game they want to watch on YouTube.

While we may be focused on making sure Kickoff Weekend goes smoothly, we’re just getting started.

Our teams will continue to build and improve on these features, both on YouTube and YouTube TV, throughout this NFL season.

We’ll see you on Sundays starting September 10th!",,,,Ready for kickoff? 6 features to add to your game plan for NFL Sunday Ticket this season,20230816,,,,en-en,"products and features, youtube sports|shorts",en,Global/Other,,,"The 2023 NFL season is fast approaching, and we couldn’t be more excited! From launching multiview on YouTube TV and now on YouTube, to enabling unlimited streams at home for NFL Sunday Ticket content, we’ve been busy bringing the best of what fans know and love about YouTube to the football experience.

Whether you’re planning to watch via YouTube or YouTube TV, here are 6 features that will be available over the next few weeks to make your Kickoff Weekend better than ever.

1.

Introduce more choice and control with monthly payment plans A big piece of feedback that we heard from you is for more flexible billing options for NFL Sunday Ticket.

Well, starting today, viewers in most states will start seeing a monthly payment plan option when signing up for NFL Sunday Ticket.

This will enable you to pay for your NFL Sunday Ticket subscription over time, versus all at once.

We will be rolling this out over the next week on both YouTube and YouTube TV, so hang tight if you don’t see it yet.

2.

Add the student plan to your back-to-school shopping list And speaking of more choices, we will be introducing student plans on YouTube for NFL Sunday Ticket within the next week.

For eligible students who love football, keep an eye out here to learn when and how to sign up.

Just in time for the new school year.

3.

Select from more multiview options Since launching early access in March, we’ve been refining the multiview experience so that all viewers, regardless of their TV device, are able to enjoy the feature.

During this upcoming NFL season, NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers will be able to choose from an extensive assortment of multiview combinations every Sunday afternoon.

If you signed up for the NFL Sunday Ticket + NFL RedZone package, your multiview options will include both out-of-market games and RedZone, whether you’re watching from YouTube or YouTube TV.

On YouTube TV, multiview combinations will also include local NFL games side-by-side with your NFL Sunday Ticket games.

And even if you’re a YouTube TV member without NFL Sunday Ticket, you can still enjoy using multiview to watch NFL games and college football this fall.

The more multiview, the merrier! 4.

Engage with live chat and polls Nothing makes game days better than being able to react to every first down, fumble and touchdown with other fans.

At the start of the season, viewers watching NFL Sunday Ticket games through YouTube will be able to enjoy live chat and polls on both their mobile and TV devices.

And soon, we’ll also add other features such as NFL Shop integrations to complement the viewing experience.

5.

Catch up with key plays on YouTube and YouTube TV We’re bringing a fan-favorite feature from YouTube TV — key plays — to YouTube.

With key plays, viewers will either be able to catch up on a game they missed or watch a quick snippet of each major play before jumping into the live game.

Key plays for YouTube will only be available on TVs this season.

6.

Jump into the action with real-time NFL highlights in YouTube Shorts NFL fans, get ready to see more NFL content on YouTube.

Starting this season, real-time highlights from every single NFL game will be available in the Shorts player, right as the action is happening.

Highlights that appear in viewers’ Shorts feeds on Sunday afternoon will include a red “Live” ring around the NFL channel avatar.

Clicking on the ring directs viewers seamlessly to the Live tab on the NFL channel, where subscribers can easily select which NFL Sunday Ticket game they want to watch on YouTube.

While we may be focused on making sure Kickoff Weekend goes smoothly, we’re just getting started.

Our teams will continue to build and improve on these features, both on YouTube and YouTube TV, throughout this NFL season.

"What do a confectioner, psychologist, and children’s songwriter all have in common? They’re all examples of the types of YouTube creators making their mark on American life.

In fact, according to a new report by Oxford Economics on the state of the U.S.

creator economy, YouTube’s creative ecosystem is having a big impact on America’s economy, society and culture.

These creative entrepreneurs are building businesses, hiring employees and contributing to their communities while making videos for the billions of people who turn to YouTube every month for entertaining, educational and enriching content.

Oxford Economics estimates that, in 2022, YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed over $35 billion to the U.S.

GDP and supported more than 390K full-time equivalent U.S.

jobs.

The report also shows that YouTube is an important source of educational content for kids and helpful information for all.

Hercules Candy is just one of the many businesses that have seen the benefits of YouTube.

First opened in 1910 by Robert Adrianos and his two brothers, the business fell on hard times and closed its store doors in 1972.

Robert’s grandson, Steve, reopened the business in 1977 and started making and selling candy out of his home, where he and his family would continue to run the business for the next 40 years.

In 2017, the Andrianos family launched the Hercules Candy YouTube channel , which offered viewers a behind the scenes look at how treats like peanut butter filled ribbon candy were made.

They quickly attracted a following of sweet-toothed subscribers and saw the demand for their products take off.

The following year, the Andrianos were finally able to open a storefront, purchase new equipment and hire additional staff.

Beyond their economic contribution, U.S.

creators are also shaping our society.

Oxford Economics found that 85% of parents who use YouTube agree that YouTube provides quality content for their children's learning and entertainment.

Additionally, 86% of teachers who use YouTube report that they have used YouTube content in their lessons and assignments.

One example of creators helping parents and kids is Dr.

Javoris Hollinsworth and his family.

Dr.

Hollinsworth started Gracie’s Corner in 2020 after noticing a lack of diverse characters in the kids programming his eight year old daughter, Graceyn, was watching.

At the time, he was a full-time chemistry professor at a university in Houston.

He wrote and recorded songs with Graceyn in his spare time from a makeshift studio he built in his home, paying animators out of pocket to bring the channel’s characters to life.

The channel steadily built a following, and in 2022, he quit his job as a professor to fully devote himself to the mission of creating educational content for kids of diverse backgrounds.

He has since hired a team to continue growing the brand, on and off YouTube.

In 2023, Gracie’s Corner was nominated for both a Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award and an NAACP Image Award.

Many creators also help broaden people’s perspective on important topics like mental health.

Dr.

Tracey Marks–a psychiatrist in Atlanta, GA who has treated thousands of patients over a 22 year career–uses YouTube to address the stigmas associated with mental health disorders and treatment.

She was inspired to start her channel after noticing how difficult it was for her to find trusted resources that provide nuanced information about mental health conditions in a way that was easy to understand.

On her channel, Dr.

Marks, posts informative and engaging videos on topics like anxiety, depression, stress management and more.

Her videos have been viewed millions of times.

And this type of mental health information that can be particularly helpful for communities where access to such resources is limited.

YouTube had over 1.4B views on mental health videos in the United States in 2021 alone.

This Oxford Economic report reinforces what I see every day: that creators are having a real and positive impact on American life.

"Last September, we announced that we are building YouTube Shorts, a short-form video experience for anyone who wants to create short, catchy videos using nothing but their mobile phones.

Since introducing our initial beta in India, we’ve already started to see creators having fun with Shorts, and the number of Indian channels using our creation tools has more than tripled since the beginning of December alone.

People are also watching more and more Shorts around the globe - the YouTube Shorts player has now surpassed 6.5 billion daily views globally.

Starting today and over the next several weeks, we’ll gradually expand our Shorts beta to the U.S.

We plan to introduce more features as we continue to build Shorts alongside creators and artists.

Here’s an update on where we’re headed with YouTube Shorts based on feedback from our community.

Unlocking a new playground of creativity With our Shorts beta in India, we had foundational creation tools, like a multi-segment camera to string multiple video clips together, the ability to record with music, control speed settings, and more.

And today we’re adding more features, like the ability to add text to specific points in your video.

You’ll also be able to sample audio from other Shorts so you can remix it into your own creation.

In the coming months, we’ll launch the ability to use audio from videos across YouTube - which includes billions of videos worldwide - unlocking a new playground of creativity like never before.

This means you can give your own creative spin on the content you love to watch on YouTube and help find it a new audience — whether it’s reacting to your favorite jokes, trying your hand at a creator’s latest recipe, or re-enacting comedic skits.

Creators will be in control and will be able to opt out if they don’t want their long form video remixed.

We’ve also worked alongside our music partners to make sure artists and creators have a large library of songs to use in their Shorts.

As we launch our beta in the US, we’ll have millions of songs (and growing), music catalogs from over 250 labels and publishers, including Universal Music Group’s labels and publishing companies, Sony Music Entertainment and Publishing, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Merlin, 300 Entertainment, Kobalt, Beggars, CD Baby, Empire, Peer, Reservoir, OneRPM and more.

As we expand Shorts, the library and number of partners will continue to grow.

Stay tuned for more Shorts creation tools rolling out in the future as we expand to more countries.

Delivering a seamless viewing experience across YouTube We know that creation is only one part of the Shorts experience.

We also want to help people find Shorts to enjoy and help creators get discovered.

We’ve introduced a row on the YouTube homepage especially for Shorts, have launched a new watch experience that lets you easily swipe vertically from one video to the next, and are testing adding a Shorts tab on mobile that makes it easier for you to watch Shorts with a single tap.

We’re also exploring how to deepen your connection with Shorts content, creators, and artists you’re most interested in by integrating it with the YouTube you already know and love.

For instance, if you hear a snippet of a song on Shorts, you can easily find the full song, watch the music video, or learn more about the artist —all on YouTube.

And soon it will work both ways.

Loving music from Megan Thee Stallion ? Tap the create button right from the video to make your own Short with that audio, or check out how others are using it on Shorts.

As more people create and watch Shorts, we expect that our systems will get even better, improving our ability to help you discover new content, trends, and creators you’ll love.

Supporting mobile creators YouTube has helped an entire generation of creators turn their creativity into businesses and become the next generation media companies.

Over the last three years, we’ve paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies.

Shorts is a new way to watch and create on YouTube, so we’re taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their content.

We are deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators with Shorts, and are actively working on what monetization options will look like in the future.

The Shorts beta will start gradually rolling out today and will be available to everybody in the U.S.

over the next several weeks.

"Update as of 3 p.m.

on 9/20/19: Yesterday, we announced changes to the verification badge.

The idea behind this update was to protect creators from impersonation and address user confusion.

Every year, we receive tens of thousands of complaints from creators about impersonation.

Also, nearly a third of YouTube users told us that they misunderstood the badge’s meaning, associating it with *endorsement of content*, and not an indicator of *identity*.

While rolling out improvements to this program, we completely missed the mark.

We’re sorry for the frustration that this caused and we have a few updates to share.

First, we heard loud and clear how much the badge means to you.

Channels that already have the verification badge will now keep it and don’t have to appeal.

We’ll continue reviewing those channels to ensure we’re protecting creators from impersonation.

Just like in the past, all channels that have over 100,000 subscribers will still be eligible to apply.

We’ll reopen the application process by the end of October.

Going forward, we’ll review those channels to verify their identity.

If we determine that a channel is attempting to impersonate, we won’t verify that channel and may take additional action.

We’ve improved the process and will verify channels that are: Authentic: Your channel must represent the real creator, brand, or entity you’re claiming to be.

We’ll look at a variety of factors to help verify your identity, and may also ask for additional info or documentation.

Complete: Your channel must be public and have a description, channel icon, and content, and be active on YouTube.

Yesterday, we also announced a new look for the verification badge that will be displayed consistently across screens.

Due to all the changes we’re announcing today, the new badge will roll out next year.

We hope that these clarifications are helpful and that these changes will improve the program for creators in the long run.

When viewers come to YouTube, it’s important that they know the channel they are watching is the official presence of the creator, artist, public figure or company that it represents.

With that in mind, we’re announcing upcoming changes to our channel verification program starting in late October.

There are two parts to the new verification program, a new look and new eligibility requirements.

New look Currently, verified channels have a checkmark next to their channel name.

Through our research, we found that viewers often associated the checkmark with an endorsement of content, not identity.

To reduce confusion about what being verified means, we’re introducing a new look that helps distinguish the official channel of the creator, celebrity or brand it represents.

As YouTube has expanded features where viewers interact with channels, including community posts, live chats and comments, the checkmark has been displayed inconsistently.

The new look will be displayed more consistently across channel pages, search and comments, and is more difficult to replicate, so that viewers can be sure of a channel’s identity.

This new look will also replace the existing music note on Official Artist Channels on YouTube.

New eligibility requirements Under our current eligibility requirements, channels with more than 100,000 subscribers can be verified regardless of need for proof of authenticity.

That worked well when YouTube was smaller, but as YouTube has grown and the ecosystem has become more complex, we needed a new way to verify the identity of channels and help users find the official channel they’re looking for.

Our new criteria prioritizes verifying prominent channels that have a clear need for proof of authenticity.

We look at a number of factors to determine if a channel meets this criteria, including: The new criteria will apply for all channels.

Channels that meet the new requirements no longer need to apply; we will automatically apply the new verified treatment.

For more info about verification and eligibility, check out our Help Center.

Authenticity: Does this channel belong to the real creator, artist, public figure or company it claims to represent? Prominence: Does this channel represent a well-known or highly searched creator, artist, public figure or company? Is this channel widely recognized outside of YouTube and have a strong presence online? Is this a popular channel that has a very similar name to many other channels?",,,,Updates to YouTube's verification program,20190919,,,,en-en,youtube news,en,United States,,,"Update as of 3 p.m.

"Editor’s note from Neal Mohan, YouTube Chief Product Officer: As the shift to e-commerce continues, video will play an increasingly important role.

Consumers want the convenience of researching and reviewing products online at home, but with the trusted guidance of an in-store experience.

That’s where YouTube’s creators come in.

They’ve committed considerable time and effort into building authentic connections with fans, and as a result, deliver trusted brand and product recommendations to their audience.

In this installment of our Innovation series, our shopping team discusses how we're integrating live shopping directly into YouTube.

Starting today, YouTube is launching a new way for you to connect with your favorite creators.

This week, the YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop will feature creators including The Merrell Twins , Simply Nailogical Donut Media Gordon Ramsay Patrick Starrr Jackie Aina Manny MUA , and MrBeast hosting shoppable livestreams — featuring exclusive access to new products, exciting giveaways, exclusive discounts, and more.

We’re also introducing YouTube.com/Shopping as a temporary destination for these livestreams.

We sat down with our shopping team to discuss some of the considerations for building live shopping and what viewers can expect.

Q: Why did YouTube decide to jump into live shopping? Wendy Yang, Product Designer, YouTube Shopping: Live shopping is an area we’re really excited about and is a huge opportunity.

The exciting thing about live shopping, and shopping generally, is that we’re already seeing it happen on YouTube — with creators revealing a product line, dropping new merch, or discussing their latest shopping haul.

People want to shop on YouTube and, according to a study we ran in partnership with Publicis and TalkShoppe, 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust .

We can make it easier to shop by integrating it directly into YouTube, removing steps in this process, and making the entire shopping experience fun and interactive for our users.

Q: What are the challenges with building a live shopping experience on YouTube? Lax Poojary, Product Manager, YouTube Shopping: When we set out to build a live shopping experience on YouTube, we wanted to let viewers discover new and relevant products through the guidance of their trusted creators.

We wanted to build features that allow for interactive and immersive exchanges between viewers and creators, so that the buying experience is engaging and fun.

But we also needed the experience to allow for shopping while making sure that the livestream is uninterrupted.

Wendy: We built the shopping features so that you can easily learn about products in the video or discover new products that you might love.

In our research, we found that 87% of people say they get the highest quality information about products when shopping or browsing on YouTube .

If you want to buy, you can make purchases using onsite check out or at retailers' sites.

That means the video stream is uninterrupted, so that you never miss a moment.

Q: What are some of the features you’re most excited about? Lax: We want to bring you closer to your favorite creators and make these livestreams interactive between creators and fans.

Creators can offer their audience live product drops, exclusive discounts, and even poll fans during their shopping livestreams to interact with and get feedback from their fans.

For example, you can imagine a creator polling their audience on what product they want to see next in the livestream or getting real time feedback on designs their audience likes best.

We are working on an exciting roadmap that brings together entertainment and shopping in one place.

Q: What goes into hosting a shoppable livestream? The team has been working really hard on making live shopping a reality for our creators and providing a great viewer experience as well.

For the YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop event, our creators are leveraging platforms like Shopify to power their stores, making it easy for their viewers to discover their products, build deeper relationships with their brands, and easily make purchases.

Some are using interactive production companies like Stage TEN to take their content to the next level.

Once the store is connected to their YouTube channel, creators can tag their favorite products and set up a live shopping stream.

Creators can even add a trailer to their upcoming live event watchpage to stimulate users to set reminders.

Our ultimate goal is to build a platform that allows anyone with a mobile device and a product to easily host a live shopping stream, but these early events will tell us a lot about what that looks like.

Q: Talk more about and what people can find there.

We created YouTube.com/Shopping as a temporary destination that allows you to revisit livestreams, discover new ones, and browse products shown in the videos in categories such as makeup, skincare, haircare, and electronics.

You can also explore featured gifts from brand and creator stores along with the top trending gift ideas from Google shopping.

Through our survey, we found that 75% of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration .

At YouTube.com/Shopping, you can browse trailers to upcoming shopping livestreams and set notifications for any livestreams that strike your interest.

Q: What do you hope to learn from the Stream and Shop events? Our week-long YouTube Holiday Stream & Shop event introduces a new way of shopping on YouTube that allows you to discover, consider, and buy the products recommended by your favorite creators.

This event is going to tell us a lot about live shopping on YouTube and help us understand what users most want to see in shoppable streams and what features creators and brands find most useful.

Heading into 2022, YouTube will continue building and investing in shopping, including features for video on demand and personalized shopping.

We’ll continue learning through these events and experimenting with new formats.

In fact, on November 17, we will premiere a new shoppable film featuring products from Black-owned businesses that you can purchase.

Our goal is to create a fun and compelling shopping experience for our viewers that addresses the growing demand for social e-commerce while strengthening the unique relationship YouTube creators have with their fans.

That means the video stream is uninterrupted, so that you never miss a moment.

Q: What are some of the features you’re most excited about? Lax: We want to bring you closer to your favorite creators and make these livestreams interactive between creators and fans.

Creators can offer their audience live product drops, exclusive discounts, and even poll fans during their shopping livestreams to interact with and get feedback from their fans.

For example, you can imagine a creator polling their audience on what product they want to see next in the livestream or getting real time feedback on designs their audience likes best.

We are working on an exciting roadmap that brings together entertainment and shopping in one place.

Q: What goes into hosting a shoppable livestream? The team has been working really hard on making live shopping a reality for our creators and providing a great viewer experience as well.

For the YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop event, our creators are leveraging platforms like Shopify to power their stores, making it easy for their viewers to discover their products, build deeper relationships with their brands, and easily make purchases.

Some are using interactive production companies like Stage TEN to take their content to the next level.

Once the store is connected to their YouTube channel, creators can tag their favorite products and set up a live shopping stream.

Creators can even add a trailer to their upcoming live event watchpage to stimulate users to set reminders.

Our ultimate goal is to build a platform that allows anyone with a mobile device and a product to easily host a live shopping stream, but these early events will tell us a lot about what that looks like.

Q: Talk more about and what people can find there.

We created YouTube.com/Shopping as a temporary destination that allows you to revisit livestreams, discover new ones, and browse products shown in the videos in categories such as makeup, skincare, haircare, and electronics.

You can also explore featured gifts from brand and creator stores along with the top trending gift ideas from Google shopping.

Through our survey, we found that 75% of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration .

At YouTube.com/Shopping, you can browse trailers to upcoming shopping livestreams and set notifications for any livestreams that strike your interest.

Q: What do you hope to learn from the Stream and Shop events? Our week-long YouTube Holiday Stream & Shop event introduces a new way of shopping on YouTube that allows you to discover, consider, and buy the products recommended by your favorite creators.

This event is going to tell us a lot about live shopping on YouTube and help us understand what users most want to see in shoppable streams and what features creators and brands find most useful.

Heading into 2022, YouTube will continue building and investing in shopping, including features for video on demand and personalized shopping.

We’ll continue learning through these events and experimenting with new formats.

In fact, on November 17, we will premiere a new shoppable film featuring products from Black-owned businesses that you can purchase.

Our goal is to create a fun and compelling shopping experience for our viewers that addresses the growing demand for social e-commerce while strengthening the unique relationship YouTube creators have with their fans.

"VR videos deliver a powerful way to share and experience the world.

From going behind the curtain with Cirque du Soleil , to diving into iconic pieces of art , to a behind-the-scenes studio tour with a TV super star, you can transport your viewers to experience moments as if they’re actually there.

We’ve heard that you want to make and see even more immersive videos on YouTube.

That’s why we’re continuing to expand the ways anyone can create and watch VR content.

More ways to watch YouTube VR With all the great content that’s available on YouTube today, we want to continue our effort to bring the YouTube VR app to everyone with a VR headset.

Starting today, the app will be available on Oculus Go headsets via the Oculus Store .

Making it easier to create VR180 content Last year we introduced VR180, a new video format that focuses on what’s in front of the camera while delivering a 3D effect in a VR headset.

By focusing only on the 180-degree view of what’s in front of the camera, it made VR video production easier for creators like you, encouraging more VR videos than ever before.

Since then we’ve introduced new tools to make this type of video creation even easier.

We launched the VR180 Creator Tool that makes it faster to process footage, add metadata and publish.

The tool is available on MacOS, Linux and now on Windows.

With the latest editing tools from Adobe, it’s also significantly easier for you to edit, add effects and publish your content.

And with new VR180 capable cameras from Kandao and Vuze , you now have more options for capturing VR180 to complement cameras from Z-Cam Lenovo Creating more immersive VR videos Spatial audio can help make haunted houses more scary and imaginary video game worlds more real.

That’s because it matches realistic sounds and picture together for a more immersive experience.

We’ve recently added support for head-locked audio, which means that you can add narration and background music that will sound the same no matter where you look.

VR videos unlock a world of experiences.
