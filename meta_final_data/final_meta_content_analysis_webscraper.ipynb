Now when you block someone, you\\u2019ll also have the option to block other accounts they may have or create, making it more difficult for them to interact with you. Last year, we updated how blocking workson Instagram to give you the ability to not only block a single account, but also any new accountssomeonemay create. This update allows you to also block existing accounts that person may already have. Based on initial test results from this new change, we expectthat four million fewer accounts will need to be blocked every weeksince these accounts will now be blocked automatically.  Sincelaunching Hidden Wordslast year, more than one in five people withmore than 10,000 followershave turned on the feature, giving them a powerful tool to automatically filter harmful content from their comments and message requests. We\\u2019ve seen that Hidden Words has beeneffective at keeping people safe. When people with more than 10,000 followers turn on Hidden Words for comments, on average, they see 40% fewer comments that might be offensive. We want to help more creators benefit from this protection, so we\\u2019re starting to test automatically turning on Hidden Words forCreator accounts. Everyone will continue to be able to turn these settings on or off at any time and build a custom list with additional words, phrases and emojis they may want to hide. We\\u2019re also continuing to improve Hidden Words to offer more protections, including:  We\\u2019ve learned that there are cases where people mean well but may misjudge how their words could negatively impact others \\u2014 especially when they\\u2019re interacting online. We\\u2019ve seen thatnudges can reduce the amount of hurtful remarks on Instagram, which is why we\\u2019re introducing more of them. Now,a new notification will encourage people to pause and consider how they want to respond before replying to a comment that our systems tell us could be offensive. These nudges are live now for people whose apps are set to English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Chinese or Arabic.  We\\u2019ve also started reminding people to be respectful in DMs when sending a message request to a creator. This nudge helps people remember that there\\u2019s a real person on the other side of their DM request, and encourages more respectful outreach to people they may not know. We\\u2019re rolling out this reminder globally in the coming weeks.  We\\u2019ll continue to work on more ways to protect people from abuse on Instagram, while encouraging supportive and respectful conversations.\",\n          \"ByAntigone Davis, Global Head of Safety, andGuy Rosen, VP of Integrity At Facebook, we rely on a combination of technology and people to help keep our platforms safe. When we identify a harmful piece of content, such as child exploitation, terrorist propaganda, or graphic violence, technology can help us find duplicates and prevent them from being shared. Today, we are open-sourcing two technologies that detect identical and nearly identical photos and videos \\u2014 sharing some of the tech we use to fight abuse on our platform with others who are working to keep the internet safe. These algorithms will be open-sourced onGitHubso our industry partners, smaller developers and non-profits can use them to more easily identify abusive content and share hashes \\u2014 or digital fingerprints \\u2014 of different types of harmful content. For those who already use their own or other content matching technology, these technologies are another layer of defense and allow hash-sharing systems to talk to each other, making the systems that much more powerful. \\u201cIn just one year, we witnessed a 541% increase in the number of child sexual abuse videos reported by the tech industry to the CyberTipline. We\\u2019re confident that Facebook\\u2019s generous contribution of this open-source technology will ultimately lead to the identification and rescue of more child sexual abuse victims,\\u201d said John Clark, President and CEO of theNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Over the years, Facebook has contributed hundreds of open-source projects to share our technology with the wider community, but this is the first time we\\u2019ve shared any photo- or video-matching technology. Building on Microsoft\\u2019s generous contribution of PhotoDNA to fight child exploitation 10 years years ago and the more recent launch of Google Content Safety API, today\\u2019s announcement also is part of an industry-wide commitment to building a safer internet. Known as PDQ and TMK+PDQF, these technologies are part of a suite of tools we use at Facebook to detect harmful content, and there are other algorithms and implementations available to industry such as pHash, Microsoft\\u2019s PhotoDNA, aHash, and dHash. Our photo-matching algorithm, PDQ, owes much inspiration to pHash although was built from the ground up as a distinct algorithm with independent software implementation. The video-matching technology, TMK+PDQF, was developed together byFacebook\\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Research teamand academics from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy. These technologies create an efficient way to store files as short digital hashes that can determine whether two files are the same or similar, even without the original image or video. Hashes can also be more easily shared with other companies and non-profits. For example, when we identify terrorist propaganda on our platforms, we remove it and hash it using a variety of techniques, including the algorithms we\\u2019re sharing today. Then we share the hashes with industry partners, including smaller companies, throughGIFCTso they can also take down the same content if it appears on their services. PDQ and TMK+PDQF were designed to operate at high scale, supporting video-frame-hashing and real-time applications. We designed these technologies based on our experience detecting abuse across billions of posts on Facebook. We hope that by contributing back to the community we\\u2019ll enable more companies to keep their services safe and empower non-profits that work in the space. This work is in addition to our ongoing research in these areas, including ourpartnershipwith The University of Maryland, Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and The University of California, Berkeley to research new techniques to detect intentional adversarial manipulations of videos and photos to circumvent our systems We\\u2019re announcing these technologies today to support our fourth annual cross-industry Child Safety Hackathon at Facebook\\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. The two-day event brings together nearly 80 engineers and data scientists fromTechnology Coalitionpartner companies and others to develop new technologies that help safeguard children. This year\\u2019s event is focused on developing new tools to help our partners, NCMEC andThorn. For example, some teams will develop a prototype feature that will allow NCMEC\\u2019s CyberTipline case management tool to query and compare data points within other nonprofit organizations\\u2019 databases for known hashes and other key information. This will help identify children at risk and highlight high value reports. The open source code released today also will be made available to teams at the hackathon. Hackathonsare an exciting way to bring people together from different organizations with a wide range of expertise to build tools that tackle problems such as the online sexual exploitation of children. All non-open-source code and prototypes developed at the event will be donated back to the Technology Coalition and our partners to be used in their child-safety efforts. We will continue to expand and improve our own products and features to find harmful content. Read more about how Facebook is using technology to combat child exploitationhere. Update on August 9, 2019 at 10:45AM PT:Here is a video from this year\\u2019s Child Safety Hackathon.\",\n          \"Today, we\\u2019re announcing several new tools to empower community builders based on feedback from group admins. There are more than 70 million admins and moderators running active Facebook groups around the world, and what they do every day is at the heart of Facebook\\u2019s mission ofbuilding community and bringing the world closer together. In fact, four years ago this month, we held our first Facebook Communities Summit in Chicago, where we announced this updated company mission with hundreds of group admins, and shared new features to nurture their communities on Facebook. We\\u2019ve continued to support them in the years since and here are the new tools we\\u2019re rolling out. Admin Homeis a simpler, more intuitive destination for all admin tools, settings and features that admins can tailor to their needs. With the new experience, admins can:  Keeping Facebook groups safe is a priority and admins play a key role in helping maintain a safe and healthy culture within their communities. We\\u2019re introducingcomment moderation to Admin Assist, allowing admins to set up criteria to automatically moderate both posts and comments. Now available across desktop and mobile, admins have the ability to: We\\u2019re also testing a new type of Moderation Alert calledConflict Alerts. This uses AI to detect and\\u00a0 notify admins when there may be contentious or unhealthy conversations in their group, so they can take action as needed. In situations where it may be helpful toslow down a conversation, admins can temporarily limit how often specific group members can comment, and control how often comments can be made on certain posts that admins select. This slideshow requires JavaScript. It\\u2019s important for admins to be able to set, shape and reinforce a community\\u2019s culture. Understanding who their members are and setting clear rules and norms for the community to follow is at the center of that. We\\u2019re introducing a newmember summaryfeature so that admins can see a consolidated summary of each group member\\u2019s activity in the group, such as the number of times they have posted and commented, or when they\\u2019ve had posts removed or been muted in the group. Admins can nowappealviolations for content they or other admins posted, or that they approved from members, as well as content from members. These appeals will be reviewed by Facebook to make sure the right decision was made. To help make it easier to share and enforce rules in Groups, admins and moderators can nowtag group rulesin comments and posts. Members can also tag specific group rules when they report posts and comments to admins, helping make community moderation simpler. Over the last few months, we\\u2019ve also made several updates to our admin tools based on specific feedback we\\u2019ve heard from our admin community. This includes features likepinned comments,admin announcement notifications,and a range of other features you can read about in ourCommunity Blog. This slideshow requires JavaScript.

We\\u2019ve connected over 2 billion people from 189 countries to reliable information about the coronavirus through our COVID-19 Information Center and informational messages, and we\\u2019ve removed more than 12 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram containing misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm. We\\u2019ve partnered with governments in more than 120 countries, as well as multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, to deliver timely information about COVID-19, including through helplines on WhatsApp. We\\u2019ve provided researchers and public health officials with real-time data and tools to help inform disease forecasting and understand the effectiveness of prevention measures. Through our Data for Good program, we\\u2019ve partnered with over 450 organizations in nearly 70 countries, the vast majority of which are leveraging our tools to support the COVID-19 response in their communities. And our publicly available datasets were downloaded over a million times in the last year by nonprofits, public health officials and researchers. But there\\u2019s still a long road ahead, and in 2021 we\\u2019re focused on supporting health leaders and public officials in their work to vaccinate billions of people against COVID-19. Building trust and confidence in these vaccines is critical, so we\\u2019re launching the largest worldwide campaign to help public health organizations share accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines and encourage people to get vaccinated as vaccines become available to them. As public officials roll out information on COVID-19 vaccine availability, we\\u2019ll help people find where and when they can get vaccinated \\u2014 similar to how we helped people find information about where and when to vote during elections. Starting this week in the US, we\\u2019ll feature links in the COVID-19 Information Center to local ministry of health websites to help people understand whether they\\u2019re eligible to get vaccinated and how to do so. And in the coming weeks, as more information becomes available, we\\u2019ll continue to expand this feature to more countries and improve it to make it easier for people to see where and when they can get vaccinated in just a few taps. We\\u2019re working with health organizations and community leaders to run campaigns on our platform promoting accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines and encouraging people to get vaccinated. We\\u2019re giving $120 million in ad credits to help health ministries, NGOs and UN agencies reach billions of people around the world with COVID-19 vaccine and preventive health information. And we\\u2019re providing training and marketing support to help governments and health organizations move quickly and reach the right people with the latest vaccine information. We\\u2019ll soon bring theCOVID-19Information Center to Instagram so people can access the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines across our apps.We\\u2019re also helping health authorities and governments share timely vaccine information over WhatsApp and provide answers to people\\u2019s questions. We partnered with the government in Indonesia to create a helpline on WhatsApp that shares information on vaccine availability first with medical workers, and eventually with the general public. In just 5 days, 500,000 medical workers \\u2014 out of 1.3 million in the country \\u2014 accessed the service. Other governments and health authorities, including the South Africa government and the WHO, are starting to create similar helplines to provide the latest vaccine information. We\\u2019re also working to amplify content that directly serves communities where vaccine intent and access may be lower. In the US, we\\u2019re partnering with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to reach Native American communities, Black communities and Latinx communities, among others, with science and evidence-based content that addresses the questions and concerns these communities have.We\\u2019re also working with AARP to reach Americans over 50 with educational content about COVID-19 vaccines, including Spanish-language content designed to reach Latinx and Hispanic communities. This builds on the work we\\u2019ve done with health organizations over the past year to increase adoption of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, such as wearing a mask. We put reminders at the top of Facebook and Instagram to wear a mask. And we reached over 26 million people with our public figure campaignencouraging people to #WearAMask, resulting in a 7-point increase in people reporting that wearing a mask in public is very or extremely important. We\\u2019ll use insights and best practices from this work to inform vaccine information campaigns and support health authorities in building confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to sharing reliable information, we are expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and Instagram about COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during the pandemic. Today, following consultations with leading health organizations, including theWHO, we\\u2019re expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines. Learn more about how we\\u2019recombating COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation. Last year, we began collaborating withCarnegie Mellon UniversityDelphi Research Groupand the University of Maryland on COVID-19 surveys about symptoms people are experiencing, mask wearing behaviors and access to care. These surveys are conducted by our academic partners and Facebook does not receive individual survey responses. With over 50 million responses to date, the survey program is one of the largest ever conducted and has helped health researchers better monitor and forecast the spread of COVID-19. It\\u2019s also the only source of global data on mask wearing, which has helped public health officials around the world in their COVID-19 response efforts. The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation used insights from the surveys to inform several mask mandates in countries such as Poland, which achieved a significant increase in mask wearing. The survey data shows that people\\u2019s willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine varies widely across the world, with over 90% of people in Denmark saying they would take a COVID-19 vaccine compared to 71% in Argentina and 62% in the Philippines. And in the US, less than 60% of Black or African American people reported they would be likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine. So to help guide the effective delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, the survey data will provide a better understanding oftrends in vaccine intentacross sociodemographics, race, geography and more. The scale of the survey will also allow for faster updates on changes in trends, such as whether vaccine intent is going up or down in California in a given week and better insights on how vaccine intent varies at a local level. We\\u2019ll share these new insights includingvaccine attitudes at a county levelin the US as well asglobally. Data has proved critical in informing the fight against COVID-19. In 2020, we launched new datasets, maps and tools to support researchers, nonprofits and governments in their COVID-19 response, and in 2021, we\\u2019ll continue to provide helpful data and insights to understand vaccine attitudes, build trust in vaccines through reliable information and support vaccination efforts.

As a company that operates platforms where public discourse takes place, Meta understands the responsibility it has to protect people\\u2019s ability to make their voices heard, and ensure we are prepared for the many elections around the world. Since 2016 we have been evolving our approach to elections to incorporate the lessons we learn and stay ahead of emerging threats. We have a dedicated team responsible for Meta\\u2019s cross-company election integrity efforts, which includes experts from our intelligence, data science, product and engineering, research, operations, content and public policy, and legal teams. In 2024, we ran a number of election operations centers around the world to monitor and react swiftly to issues that arose, including in relation to the major elections in the US, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, the EU Parliament, France, the UK, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil. With the US election in the books, we are in a position to share some of the trends we\\u2019ve seen on our platforms, and explain how we have sought to balance protecting people\\u2019s ability to express themselves with keeping people safe throughout the year. Striking the balance between allowing people to make their voices heard and keeping people safe is one that no platform will ever get right 100 per cent of the time. We know that when enforcing our policies, our error rates are too high, which gets in the way of the free expression we set out to enable. Too often harmless content gets taken down or restricted and too many people get penalized unfairly. Throughout the year we have sought to update and apply our content policies fairly so that people can make their voices heard, and we will continue to work on this in the months ahead. Throughout elections around the world in 2024, we connected people with reliable information about voting through in-app notifications on Facebook and Instagram. Meta also continues to offer industry-leading transparency for ads about social issues, elections and politics. Advertisers who run these ads are required to complete an authorization process and include a \\u201cpaid for by\\u201d disclaimer. These ads are then stored in our publicly availableAd Libraryfor seven years. This year, we continued to prohibit new political, electoral and social issue ads in the US during the final week of the election campaign as we have since 2020, because in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims. Since January 2024, in certain cases we\\u2019ve also required advertisers to disclose when they use AI or other digital techniques to create or alter a political or social issue ad. At the start of the year, many people were warning of the potential impact of generative AI on the upcoming elections, including the risk of widespread deepfakes and AI-enabled disinformation campaigns. From what we\\u2019ve monitored across our services, it seems these risks did not materialize in a significant way and that any such impact was modest and limited in scope. This year, our teams have taken down around 20 new covert influence operations around the world, including in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and the US. These findings and policies are intended to give you a sense of what we\\u2019ve seen and the broad approach we have taken during this unprecedented year of elections, but they are far from an exhaustive account of everything we did and saw. Nor is our approach inflexible. With every major election, we want to make sure we are learning the right lessons and staying ahead of potential threats. Striking the balance between free expression and security is a constant and evolving challenge. As we take stock of what we\\u2019ve learned during this remarkable year, we will keep our policies under review and announce any changes in the months ahead.\",\n          \"By Travis Yeh, Product Manager People come together on Facebook to talk about, advocate for, and connect around things like nutrition, fitness and health issues.But in order to help people get accurate health information and the support they need, it\\u2019s imperative that we minimize health content that is sensational or misleading. In ourongoing effortsto improve the quality of information in News Feed, we consider ranking changes based on how they affect people, publishers and our community as a whole. We know thatpeople don\\u2019t like posts that are sensational or spammy, and misleading health content is particularly bad for our community. So, last month we made two ranking updates to reduce (1) posts with exaggerated or sensational health claims and (2) posts attempting to sell products or services based on health-related claims. We handled this in a similar way to how we\\u2019vepreviouslyreduced low-quality content likeclickbait: by identifying phrases that were commonly used in these posts to predict which posts might include sensational health claims or promotion of products with health-related claims, and then showing these lower in News Feed. We\\u2019ll continue working to minimize low-quality health content on Facebook. Will This Impact My Page? We anticipate that most Pages won\\u2019t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update. Posts with sensational health claims or solicitation using health-related claims will have reduced distribution. Pages should avoid posts about health that exaggerate or mislead people and posts that try to sell products using health-related claims. If a Page stops posting this content, their posts will no longer be affected by this change.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Facebook Meta\",\n          \"\",\n          \"Meta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 66,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Combating Misinformation, Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, Security News, Integrity and Security\",\n          \"Combating Misinformation, Community Standards and Enforcement, Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, Security News, Data and Privacy, Integrity and Security\",\n          \"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Combating Misinformation, Community Standards and Enforcement, Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, Elections, Safety, Election Integrity, Integrity and Security, Public Policy, Safety and Expression\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The revamped Privacy Checkup tool has expanded to four distinct topics to help you strengthen your account security and control who can see what you share and how your information is used. We know privacy is personal and we\\u2019ve integrated privacy tips to help you make the right privacy decisions for you.  Who Can See What You Sharewill help you review who can see your profile information, like your phone number and email address, as well as your posts.  How to Keep Your Account Securewill help you strengthen your account security by setting a stronger password and turning on login alerts.  How People Can Find You on Facebookwill let you review ways in which people can look you up on Facebook and who can send you friend requests.  Your Data Settings on Facebookwill let you review the information you share with apps you\\u2019ve logged into with Facebook. You can also remove the apps you no longer use.  The Privacy Checkup tool has been live since 2014 and the new version is rolling out globally this week. Learn more in theHelp Center.\",\n          \"WhatsApp\\u2019s mission is to connect the world privately. As more of our conversations move from face-to-face to digital, we acknowledge there is a certain magic in just sitting down with someone in-person, sharing your thoughts in confidence, knowing you are both connecting in private and in that moment. The freedom to be honest and vulnerable, knowing that conversation isn\\u2019t being recorded and stored somewhere forever. Deciding how long a message lasts should be in your hands. We\\u2019ve become accustomed to leaving a digital copy of just about everything we type without even thinking about it. It\\u2019s become the equivalent of a note taker following us around making a permanent record of everything we\\u2019ve said. This is why we introduceddisappearing messageslast year, and more recently a way for photos and videos to immediately disappear after beingviewed once. Today we are excited to provide our users with more options to control their messages and how long they stick around, with default disappearing messages and multiple durations. WhatsApp users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages by default for all new chats. When enabled, all new one-on-one chats you or another person start will be set to disappear at your chosen duration, and we\\u2019ve added a new option when creating a group chat that lets you turn it on for groups you create. This new feature is optional and does not change or delete any of your existing chats. We are also adding two new durations for disappearing messages: 24 hours and 90 days, as well as the existing option of 7 days.  For people who choose to switch on default disappearing messages, we will display a message in your chats that tells people this is the default you\\u2019ve chosen. This makes clear it\\u2019s nothing personal \\u2013 it\\u2019s a choice you\\u2019ve made about how you want to communicate with everyone on WhatsApp moving forward. Though of course, if you need a particular conversation to remain permanent, it\\u2019s easy to switch a chat back. Living apart from family and friends for over a year has made it clearer than ever that just because we can\\u2019t physically talk in person, it doesn\\u2019t mean we should have to sacrifice the privacy of our personal conversations. We believe disappearing messages along with end-to-end encryption are two crucial features that define what it means to be a private messaging service today, and bring us one step closer to the feeling of an in-personal conversation. To get started, go to your Privacy settings and select \\u201cDefault Message Timer.\\u201d Learn morehere.\",\n          \"By Karina Newton, Head of Policy, Instagram We know people want to stay connected with their close friends online. That\\u2019s why Facebook is launchingThreads, a new camera-first messaging app from Instagram for keeping up with your close friends in a dedicated space. We built Threads with privacy in mind, so that you can feel comfortable using the app to communicate with your close friends. What choices and controls do I have?   How does this impact data collection and the ads I see? If you enable Auto Status, Threads will request your location, movement, battery level and network connection from your phone in order to determine what context to share. For example, Auto Status might use your precise location to show your friends that you\\u2019re \\u201c\\u2615 At a cafe.\\u201d\\u00a0 Or Auto Status might detect that you\\u2019re biking and set your status to \\u201c\\ud83d\\udeb2On the Move.\\u201d Before this is enabled, you\\u2019ll be told what information Auto Status is requesting and will be asked to specifically agree.\\u00a0 Auto Status will not share your precise location with your friends, and when Threads sends location information to our server to look up locations, it\\u2019s not stored there \\u2013 this information is only stored on your device for a limited time. It is also deleted if you remove Threads. The way we use data from other parts of Facebook and Instagram to deliver relevant ads to you remains the same. Precise location information collected for Auto Status is a new feature specific to Threads and will not be used for ads. Who sees my information and activity? Threads is for connecting with your close friends list on Instagram, which you control. Your conversations are between you and the people you\\u2019re talking to, and only your close friends will see your status. As with the main Instagram app, you can easily and anonymously report any message you feel violates our Community Guidelines. We also haveresources for parentsthat highlight some of the tools we have in place to keep teens safe. We\\u2019re committed to protecting people\\u2019s well-being and privacy, so people can feel comfortable connecting with their close friends.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Instagram\",\n          \"Meta\",\n          \"Facebook\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 110,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Data for Good, Privacy Matters, Data and Privacy, Public Policy\",\n          \", Data and Privacy, Integrity and Security\",\n          \"Community Standards Enforcement Report, Data and Privacy, Integrity and Security, Public Policy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
