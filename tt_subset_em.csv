Take a deeper look at the content with this new feature in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects.||Current Top Trend: #NotAPerfectPerson||Nobody is perfect and creators on TikTok have banned together to own their flaws with the #NotAPerfectPerson trend. Set to Hoobastank's 2003 hit ""The Reason,"" this trend features creators admitting to unflattering personal quirks or actions before lip syncing the iconic line, ""I'm not a perfect person.""||This trend's confessional, comedic vibes has helped it spread across the platform with users admitting to everything from stealing snacks to admitting hypocrisy in their lives. It's become so popular that a counter trend formed using an augmented sound to say ""I am a perfect person."" These videos poke fun at the self confidence felt after accomplishing minor tasks like removing makeup after a night out or remembering to bring reusable bags to the grocery story. Both of these trends show the humor in our daily life, leading them to become top trends of the week.||#NotAPerfectPerson highlights how TikTok creators can be creative without presenting themselves in a perfect light. Many social networks seem to be filtered versions of people who only show their best highlights, but with #NotAPerfectPerson, creators are encouraged to laugh at themselves while inviting others to join in on the fun.||Notable Video||Hot Track: Paparazzi||Kim Dracula's cover of the classic Lady Gaga song Paparazzi has given creators the perfect track for their videos. The song's slow beginning leads to an enthusiastic drop that's perfect for transitions or exciting moments.||Hot Effect: Old Face||Have you ever wondered what you'd look like as an older individual? Wonder no more with TikTok's latest Old Face Creative Effect!||Creator Spotlight: @dadlifejason||Jason is a husband and father of three children. As the patriarch of a multiracial family, he uses his platform to share family moments and experiences.

Industry collaboration is vital and we look forward to working with TikTok and other industry partners towards our common goal of ending the sexual exploitation of children online. During our conversations with TikTok we’ve been struck by the platform’s genuine commitment to prioritising the safety of its youngest users and the recent decision to restrict under-16s’ access to its Direct Messaging feature is one example of its willingness to put child safety first."" Iain Drennan, Executive Director, WeProtect Global Alliance||About WePROTECT Global Alliance||Online child sexual exploitation cannot be dealt with by any one country, company or organisation working in isolation and instead demands a coordinated global response. The WePROTECT Global Alliance is that response: an independent global coalition of 97 countries, 32 technology companies and 33 civil society organisations working to put the sexual exploitation of children online on the global agenda and mobilise an international campaign to end it. We do this through:||1) Advocacy - to ensure decision-makers take action through empowering children, victims and survivors;||2) Knowledge - to be the definite source of knowledge on threat and response;||3) Collaboration- to forge new networks and drive collaboration for a truly global response.","```json

Cette exposition mêle artistes internationaux tels que Mélanie Courtinat, Lauren Moffatt, ou Theo Triantafyllidis notamment, et la jeune génération représentée par les plus prestigieuses écoles de design et d'image au monde. Ils pourront aussi visiter l'espace TikTok et s'exercer à réaliser des vidéos TikTok en réalité augmentée.||TikTok a souhaité naturellement apporter son soutien à l'école de l'image GOBELINS en permettant à ses artistes d'exprimer toute leur créativité. Très attentifs au monde qui les entoure, aux enjeux auxquels est confronté notre environnement, les élèves ont souhaité offrir au public de Palais Augmenté, une œuvre porteuse de sens et qui donne à réfléchir. Animé par l’idée d’un jardin post Anthropocène, chaque élève a mis à profit ses savoir-faire, sa créativité et son inspiration pour proposer Japosta, une œuvre imaginaire dramatique et fascinante à la fois, représentant une espèce végétale et animale qui nous perdurerait.||Eric Garandeau, Directeur Relations Institutionnelles et Affaires Publiques de TikTok France :""TikTok est la plateforme où les artistes et les communautés se rassemblent pour exprimer leur créativité et partager leurs oeuvres. TikTok est le nouveau Fluxus - une grande oeuvre collective qui s'écrit et se partage en temps réel, mondialement. Nous sommes tout aussi fiers de contribuer à faire vivre les arts au-delà de notre plateforme grâce au programme TikTokForGood dans lequel s'inscrit ce partenariat avec la RMN - Grand Palais et l'école GOBELINS. Ainsi, nous permettons aux jeunes créateurs numériques de toucher un large public par une oeuvre originale qui porte aussi un questionnement sur la place de la nature dans notre civilisation.""||TikTok, engagée auprès du monde de la culture||Véritable fenêtre sur le monde, TikTok est la plateforme d'expression de la culture sous toutes ses formes. Un espace où l'on partage ses passions, où l'on se sent libre d'exprimer sa créativité. Un lieu de rencontre, d'expression, de découverte comme aucun autre.||Très engagée auprès du monde de la culture, tant en France qu'à l'international, TikTok a notamment pu proposer à ses utilisateurs deux grandes saisons culturelles #CultureTikTok. Ces deux événements ""in-app"" ont permis à la communauté TikTok d'assouvir sa soif de découverte, et aux musées et théâtres de maintenir un lien essentiel avec leurs audiences tout en donnant à voir à un plus large public leurs trésors et créations.||Avec Palais Augmenté, TikTok accompagne l'art numérique et offre ainsi au plus grand nombre une expérience culturelle hors du commun.","{""actions"": [],

Wir arbeiten rund um die Uhr daran, diese Umgebung aufrechtzuerhalten, indem wir Richtlinien entwickeln, die helfen, aufkommende Risiken zu bekämpfen. Außerdem konzentrieren wir uns auf die konsequente Entwicklung unserer Sicherheitsfunktionen.||Ein wesentlicher Teil unserer Bemühungen ist die Zusammenarbeit mit Partnerorganisationen, um unseren Sicherheits-Ansatz zu stärken. Wir freuen uns sehr, bekannt geben zu können, dass TikTok der Globalen Koalition zur Beendigung des illegalen Wildtierhandels im Internet beigetreten ist. Die Koalition wurde 2018 vom World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC und IFAW gegründet und bringt E-Commerce-, Such- und Online-Plattformen auf der ganzen Welt zusammen, um den Online-Wildtierhandel zu reduzieren.||Maßnahmen, die wir ergreifen, um Tierhandel zu verhindern||Unsere Community-Richtlinien machen bereits deutlich, dass jegliche Inhalte, die die Wilderei oder den illegalen Handel mit Wildtieren darstellen oder fördern, auf unserer Plattform nicht erlaubt sind und entfernt werden, wenn sie identifiziert werden. Seit November haben unsere Teams 85,3 % dieser Art von Inhalten entfernt, bevor sie von Nutzer*innen angesehen wurden. Unsere Werberichtlinien machen auch deutlich, dass wir die Werbung für Produkte, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Handel von geschützten Tieren stehen, oder den Verkauf von Tieren selbst, verbieten.||Wir wissen, dass die Kriminellen, die den Wildtierhandel erleichtern, ständig ihre Taktiken ändern, um nicht entdeckt zu werden. Das macht diese Art von Partnerschaft unerlässlich. Die Zusammenarbeit mit der Koalition ermöglicht den Austausch innerhalb der Branche, unterstützt die Überwachung neuer Entwicklungen und gibt uns die Möglichkeit, ehrliches Feedback zu erhalten, das uns hilft, uns weiter zu verbessern.||""Das Ausmaß des Online-Wildtierhandels ist angesichts seiner illegalen Natur sehr schwer zu quantifizieren, aber wir wissen, dass Online-Plattformen wie TikTok für die Lösung des Problems von entscheidender Bedeutung sind. Seit der Gründung der Globalen Koalition zur Beendigung des illegalen Wildtierhandels im Internet haben die 39 teilnehmenden Unternehmen 4 Millionen verbotene Wildtierangebote gesperrt oder entfernt. Wir freuen uns darauf, mit TikTok zusammenzuarbeiten und dabei zu helfen, seine Millionen von Nutzer*innen zu mobilisieren, um auf kreative Weise zu verhindern, dass dieser illegale Handel auf der Plattform wächst"", sagt Giavanna Grein, Senior Program Officer, TRAFFIC at WWF||Wir freuen uns, mit der Globalen Koalition zur Beendigung des illegalen Wildtierhandels im Internet zusammenzuarbeiten, um einige der am meisten gefährdeten Tiere unseres Planeten zu schützen.

EMEA 신뢰와 안전 허브는 틱톡이 유럽 현지의 문화와 맥락에 대한 이해를 바탕으로 한 활동을 보장하고, 이용자 안전과 관련한 최고 수준의 기준을 추구하기 위해 유럽 내 규제 당국, 정책 입안자, 정부 및 사법 기관과의 공조를 목표로 합니다.||올초 20명 미만의 직원으로 시작한 EMEA 신뢰와 안전 허브는 현재 약 600명의 직원이 유럽 내 이용자 안전 유지를 담당하고 있습니다. 유럽 및 영국 대상의 모든 이용자 안전 전략, 의사 결정과 운영은 숙련된 팀원들이 지역 전문가의 지원 하에 근무하고 있습니다. 또한 해당 팀은 미성년자 안전 및 혐오 발언 분야 등의 전문가, 정책 수립과 프로세스 및 품질 보증 등을 포함한 폭넓은 부문을 담당하는 시니어 리더가 이끌고 있습니다. ||EMEA 신뢰와 안전 허브의 빠른 성장은 틱톡 커뮤니티의 경이로운 성장을 뒷받침합니다. 현재 유럽에서는 월간 1억여 명의 이용자가 틱톡에서 활발하게 활동 중입니다. 틱톡은 유럽 커뮤니티가 지속적으로 성장하기를 바라며, 이를 위해 틱톡을 긍정적이고 창의적인 표현을 할 수 있는 안전한 플랫폼으로 유지하기 위해 최선을 다하고 있습니다.||커뮤니티가 성장함에 따라 확장에 대한 필요도 대두됩니다. 틱톡은 EMEA 신뢰와 안전팀을 만들고 육성하는 데 우선순위를 두는 한편, 커뮤니티 안전 외에도 유럽 지역에 대한 전략적으로 중요한 투자를 계속할 것입니다. 현재 2천여 명의 직원이 브랜드 및 크리에이터 관리, 상용화, 음악, 제품, 정책 및 안전을 비롯한 다양한 부문을 담당하고 있습니다. 직원수는 급증가하고 있으며, 아일랜드에서만 향후 3개월간 최소 200여 개의 일자리가 창출되어 2021년 1월에는 총 직원 수가 1,100명 이상이 될 것으로 예상합니다.||틱톡이 최근 발족한 유럽 데이터 보호 및 프라이버시 팀은 또 하나의 주요 부서입니다. 지난 여름 EMEA 프라이버시 담당 총괄과 데이터 보호 담당 총괄 임명에서 더 나아간 결과입니다. 또한 틱톡은 2022년까지 아일랜드에 유럽 내 첫 데이터센터를 설립할 예정입니다. 4억 2천만 유로 규모의 투자를 통해 데이터센터는 수백 개의 새로운 일자리를 창출하고, 궁극적으로는 틱톡의 유럽 이용자 데이터의 본거지로 거듭날 것입니다.||확장 중인 유럽지역 서비스 운영에 있어 상업 비즈니스 분야는 또 다른 중요한 축입니다. 사업 규모가 크든 작든, 무엇을 제작하거나 또 판매하든 모든 브랜드는 틱톡에서 발굴될만한 가치가 있으며, 틱톡 커뮤니티의 한 부분으로 환영받습니다. 특히 중소기업은 글로벌 경제의 중추로써, 유럽에서의 성장의 주요 동력입니다. 이에 따라 아일랜드 외부에서 SMB 사업부 총괄과 지속적으로 확장 중인 SMB 팀이 이끄는 SMB 센터는 기업들이 틱톡 커뮤니티와 소통하고 틱톡을 통해 사업을 키우도록 지원을 아끼지 않고 있습니다.||미하일 마틴 (Micheál Martin) 아일랜드 총리: “틱톡은 훌륭한 성공 사례로, 아일랜드에서 서비스를 시작한 후 단 기간 내에 놀라운 성과를 이뤄냈습니다. 글로벌 시장에서의 틱톡의 부상은 2020년 초 20여 명으로 시작했던 아일랜드 직원 수가 현재 900여명에 이르는 등 아일랜드에서의 성장에서도 여실히 드러나고 있습니다. 아일랜드에 대한 틱톡의 헌신과 2021년까지 직원 수를 1,100명 이상으로 늘리겠다고 한 약속을 환영합니다. 이는 양질의 일자리이며, 최고 수준의 데이터 보호 기준을 유지하며 사람들이 앱을 안전하게 이용할 수 있게 하는데 목표를 두고 있습니다.”||""신규 데이터 센터를 아일랜드에 설립하기로 한 틱톡의 결정에 따라 수백 개의 새로운 일자리가 창출될 것입니다. 이러한 투자 결정은 아일랜드 질 높은 노동력을 확인시켜주는 동시에, 아일랜드를 디지털 혁신의 최전선에 두겠다는 정부의 약속을 분명히 보여줍니다.”||리오 버라드커(Leo Varadkar TD) 외교부 장관 겸 기업무역고용부 장관: “이번 결정은 틱톡의 아일랜드 내 사업 부문 중에서 신뢰와 안전, 데이터 보호 및 개인정보 보호 분야의 모든 중요한 부문에 대한 대대적인 확장입니다. 틱톡이 아일랜드에서의 사업을 확장해 현재까지 900여 개의 일자리를 창출하고, 2021년 1월 말까지 200여개의 일자리를 추가 창출하기로 한 결정을 환영합니다. 이는 아일랜드가 기술 혁신가들에게 있어 최고의 선택지임을 입증합니다.”||바네사 파파스(Vanessa Pappas) 틱톡 임시 최고 경영자: ""틱톡이 올해 경험한 경이로운 성장에 진심으로 겸허하게 생각합니다. 생동감 있는 크리에이터 커뮤니티를 지원하기 위해 틱톡은 유럽 내에서 상업화, 음악, 제품, 프라이버시, 정책 및 안전 분야 전반에 걸쳐 2천여 개의 새로운 일자리를 창출했으며, 앞으로도 많은 일자리를 창출할 것입니다. 이는 유럽의 풍부한 인재 풀, 다양성을 갖춘 기술 분야, 풍요로운 예술∙문화유산이 틱톡으로 하여금 유럽을 매력적인 투자처로 여기도록 만든 덕분입니다. 어제 아일랜드 총리를 만나 틱톡이 이룬 경이로운 성장, 지역 내 향후 투자 계획 및 틱톡을 통해 번성한 유럽의 크리에이터 커뮤니티 등에 대해 이야기를 나눌 수 있어 영광이었습니다.”||틱톡은 다른 커뮤니티와 다릅니다. 틱톡은 이용자에게 즐거움과 정보를 제공하고, 크리에이터가 커리어에 야망을 가지도록 북돋아주며, 브랜드에게 특별한 기회를 제공하고, 아티스트들이 흥미진진하게 예상치 못한 방식으로 청중에게 다가가 소통할 수 있게 합니다. 틱톡의 팀을 구성하는 인재의 확장이 없었다면 불가능했을 일입니다. 신뢰와 안전, 데이터 프라이버시와 보호, 상용화 부문 전반을 이끌기 위해 유럽에서 모인 높은 역량의 리더들 역시 틱톡의 지속적인 성장과 확장에 있어 매우 중요합니다.","```json

4831,tt_4831,https://newsroom.tiktok.com/it-it/tiktok-introduce-la-policy-per-i-media-affiliati-a-uno-stato,"di Justin Erlich, Global Head of Issue Policy & Partnerships, Trust & Safety||In TikTok vogliamo fornire alla community il maggior contesto possibile e gli strumenti più adatti a valutare i contenuti presenti in piattaforma. Per questo motivo, per esempio, aggiungiamo etichette ai video che contengono informazioni non comprovate, mentre le spunte blu aiutano gli utenti a capire se il titolare di un account è davvero chi afferma di essere. L’anno scorso abbiamo avviato un progetto pilota che prevedeva di aggiungere etichette ai contenuti dei media controllati dallo Stato, cominciando con Russia, Ucraina e Bielorussia. Un progetto che oggi ampliamo attraverso una policy globale, andando ad aggiungere tali etichette a tutti i media affiliati a uno Stato così da aiutare gli utenti a comprendere meglio le fonti dei contenuti che stanno guardando.||Il nostro approccio ai media affiliati a uno Stato||La policy prevede di identificare gli account gestiti da organizzazioni i cui prodotti editoriali o processi decisionali siano soggetti al controllo o influenzati da un governo. L’obiettivo di introdurre delle etichette per i media affiliati a uno stato è quello di assicurare che tutti dispongano di un contesto accurato, trasparente e fruibile quando entrano in contatto con contenuti proposti da account di media che potrebbero presentare il punto di vista di un governo.||Partito lo scorso anno, il progetto pilota relativo ai media affiliati a uno stato ha previsto incontri con oltre 60 esperti tra media, politologi, accademici e rappresentanti di organizzazioni internazionali e della società civile in Nord e Sud America, Africa, Europa, Medio Oriente, Asia e Australia. Abbiamo inoltre consultato i nostri Content and Safety Advisory Council e abbiamo collaborato a stretto contatto con una società leader globale nel monitoraggio dei media allo sviluppo di una metodologia convalidata in modo indipendente, che guidi le nostre decisioni rispetto alla categorizzazione dei media affiliati a uno stato.||Come valutiamo l’indipendenza editoriale da uno Stato||Nel valutare l’indipendenza editoriale, consideriamo gli intenti dichiarati dall’organizzazione, le pratiche editoriali con le misure che le proteggono, la direzione e la linea editoriale, e le effettive decisioni editoriali. Effettuiamo anche un’ulteriore analisi sulle organizzazioni che risultano dipendenti in maniera significativa da fondi pubblici, direttamente o tramite investimenti pubblicitari, prestiti e sussidi. Ecco alcune delle domande relative ai criteri che guidano la nostra categorizzazione:||L'indipendenza editoriale è parte della mission dichiarata dell’organizzazione? | L’organizzazione dispone di un sistema di linee guida relative ai principi deontologici del giornalismo? | Ci sono posizioni di leadership a livello manageriale o editoriale che possono essere considerate affiliate allo Stato?||L’organizzazione dichiara in modo trasparente eventuali situazioni di affiliazione allo Stato? | Esistono prove che la testata non applichi le proprie linee guida editoriali? | In che modo l’organizzazione gestisce le questioni di rilevante interesse pubblico che riguardano il governo?||Questi criteri ci aiutano quindi a categorizzare l’organizzazione e sulla base dell'analisi che ne emerge applichiamo l’etichetta al profilo e ai contenuti del suo account.||L’estensione dell’utilizzo dell’etichetta ai media a controllo statale||Stiamo estendendo l’utilizzo dell’etichetta al di là del progetto pilota, secondo un approccio che procede per fasi. Partiremo da oltre 40 mercati in numerose aree geografiche e proseguiremo gradualmente su ulteriori gruppi di mercati.||La procedura di ricorso||Abbiamo dedicato diversi mesi a sviluppare una metodologia obiettiva applicabile in modo coerente dal team di Trust and Safety , che supervisiona le decisioni sulle segnalazioni dei media affiliati allo stato. Siamo consapevoli, tuttavia, che qualche elemento di contesto può sempre portare a errori occasionali e stiamo introducendo una procedura di appello per le organizzazioni che ritengono di essere state erroneamente identificate come media a controllo statale. Per fare ricorso, l’organizzazione può presentare informazioni aggiuntive che riportino le misure adottate a protezione dell’indipendenza editoriale. Valuteremo le prove fornite e chiederemo il parere di autorevoli esperti indipendenti, rimuovendo l’etichetta se riscontreremo che, effettivamente, l’ente non corrisponde ai nostri criteri che definiscono un media affiliato allo Stato.||Continueremo a considerare ulteriori modalità per fornire un contesto agli utenti su TikTok.","{""actions"":[

Alle persone che mi seguono vorrei trasmettere un semplice messaggio: se vuoi puoi seguire il tuo sogno e le tue passioni.||ll tuo primo TikTok||Nel mio primo TikTok mostravo come mantenere una ripresa stabile e, anziché fare le scale creando brusche interruzioni, ho optato per una scivolata sul corrimano ||Il tuo TikTok preferito||Il mio TikTok preferito è stato poco dopo la fine del primo lockdown, quando due follower mi hanno fermato riconoscendomi. Molta emozione da entrambe le parti, e l’occasione per regalare qualche scatto per l’affetto||Consigli per aspiranti creator||1. Impara a gestire le tue energie e la creatività.||2. Condividi ciò che sai e non essere geloso dei tuoi lavori. Le persone si affezionano a te, non solo alle tue idee.||3. Creare qualcosa di personale e in grado di lasciare il segno. In questo modo, potrai costruire qualcosa di valore e durevole nel tempo.||Progetti futuri||Tutta la mia vita è cambiata molto con TikTok: sono diventato un riferimento nel mio settore, ma foto e video sono anche il mio lavoro e i numeri così alti hanno portato tante nuove opportunità. Il web ha avuto e continuerà ad avere un ruolo decisivo per consentire alle persone di connettersi e le piattaforme, per come la vedo io, verranno sempre più utilizzate come strumenti di espressione sincera e di comunicazione. Sebbene i miei progetti per il futuro siano incerti, dettati dalla situazione odierna, resta l’idea di trasferirmi a Los Angeles per qualche anno per crescere come filmmaker e magari entrare nel mondo cinema. Vorrei studiare ancora tanto e lavorare con persone che hanno un sogno simile al mio.||Un'idea per Natale||Non è un caso se qualcuno disse (e cantò) che Natale è the most wonderful time of the year: le luci, le decorazioni, le canzoni a tema creano un'atmosfera unica e magica! E perfetta per creare scatti suggestivi. Nicola lo racconta nei suoi video, pochi passi per un effetto professionale, che stupirà tutti. Protagonista è l'albero di Natale con le sue scintillanti file di stelline e un cartoncino a forma

Consapevole della gravità di questa situazione, TikTok, la piattaforma creativa per i video in formato breve, si è mobilitata a supporto dell’emergenza sia a livello globale sia a livello locale, in particolare a sostegno del personale sanitario che combatte ogni giorno contro la pandemia. TikTok ha annunciato oggi che donerà complessivamente 5 milioni di euro per la lotta contro l’emergenza Covid-19 in Italia. ||Il Fondo di Solidarietà TikTok per il personale sanitario (TikTok Health Heroes Relief Fund) prevede una donazione di 2,5 milioni di euro destinata alla Protezione Civile Italiana, che verranno usati – d’intesa con il Commissario Straordinario per l’Emergenza, Domenico Arcuri – per l’acquisto di dispositivi e apparecchiature per il contrasto al Coronavirus, distribuiti ogni giorno alle Regioni e alle Province autonome per fronteggiare l’emergenza.|| Altri 2,5 milioni di euro andranno alla Federazione Nazionale degli Ordini delle Professioni Infermieristiche (FNOPI) e il Comitato centrale gestirà la distribuzione dei fondi in base alle domande che stanno già pervenendo dagli infermieri. L’obiettivo è quello di supportare, sia nella fase della malattia che del recupero, fisico e psicologico, in particolar modo tutti gli infermieri che per primi hanno aiutato le persone colpite dal virus e ora sono bisognosi anch’essi di cure mediche o della terapia intensiva (al momento, se ne contano oltre 9.600). Il fondo vuole essere una garanzia per il necessario supporto anche a tutti coloro che sono costretti a vivere in quarantena, lontani dai propri affetti per prevenire l’ulteriore diffusione del virus, e alle famiglie di chi in questi mesi ha subito la perdita di un famigliare infermiere e si trovano ad affrontare problemi di natura economica e sociale. ||“La sensibilità mostrata da TikTok verso gli infermieri e le loro famiglie - afferma FNOPI - è un sostegno cruciale in un momento così delicato. Inoltre, è un riconoscimento verso chi si è esposto in prima linea per combattere il nemico invisibile, assistendo sia con cure mediche che affetto i pazienti rimasti soli nelle strutture ospedaliere. Grazie alla donazione, numerosi saranno i professionisti, o le loro famiglie, che potranno usufruire di un aiuto economico, tornando, prima del previsto, ad aiutare gli altri in corsia.”||Questo annuncio fa parte dei programmi di sostegno alla lotta contro la pandemia che TikTok ha annunciato lo scorso 9 aprile con una donazione globale di 250 milioni di dollari e la creazione di un Fondo di Solidarietà TikTok per il personale medico e infermieristico (Health Heroes Relief Fund). Al livello europeo, 50 milioni di dollari (45 milioni di euro) sono destinati a supportare gli operatori del settore sanitario, educatori e le comunità locali. In Europa TikTok collabora con la Fondazione RCN (Royal College of Nursing) nel Regno Unito, la Fondation Hopitaux de France in Francia e della Francoforte Sisterhoods della Croce Rossa tedesca in Germania.||Richard Waterworth, General Manager EU di TikTok, dichiara: “Con le diverse iniziative e donazioni che stiamo mettendo in atto vorremmo mostrare il nostro rispetto e il nostro impegno a quelle persone che sono in prima linea nella lotta contro la pandemia. Operatori sanitari, professionisti medici e infermieri stanno mettendo a repentaglio la propria sicurezza, separandosi volontariamente dalle proprie famiglie e lavorando in circostanze difficili con l’unico obiettivo di salvare vite umane. Un aiuto economico, psicologico e concreto, anche fatto di attrezzature e dispositivi per la protezione e cura di operatori e malati.”||La sezione Supportiamo la nostra community nell’emergenza COVID-19, disponibile sul sito TikTok e sulla app all’interno del Centro Sicurezza, si aggiunge al costante impegno di TikTok durante l'emergenza di Covid-19 per informare, proteggere e ispirare la community tramite risorse educative, live streaming informativie di intrattenimento e challenge coinvolgenti per aiutare le persone a rimanere attive, divertirsi e darsi coraggio. ","```json

**Evidence:**

1. **Read through news release and identify non-trivial, discrete actions:**
   - The news release discusses TikTok's financial donations to support healthcare workers and communities affected by COVID-19.
   - It mentions the creation of a TikTok Health Heroes Relief Fund and donations to various organizations.

2. **Test whether the identified action matches the inclusion criteria of I1, I2, I3:**
   - **I1 (Digital harm or well-being):** The actions are related to financial support for healthcare workers and communities, which is not directly associated with digital harm or well-being such as user safety, privacy, or harmful content on the platform.
   - **I2 (Product, feature, policy, or information):** The actions involve financial donations, not changes to a product, feature, policy, or provision of information to users on the platform.
   - **I3 (Implementation):** The donations are already being implemented, but they do not involve changes to the platform itself.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - None of the actions described in the news release qualify as digital well-being changes according to the specified criteria. The actions are philanthropic efforts rather than changes to the platform's digital environment or user experience.

Desde su lanzamiento, en octubre de 2023, el programa ha formado a un total de 1.805 alumnos y 27 padres.||La seguridad de los menores es la máxima prioridad para TikTok, y este programa quiere llevar hasta ellos las funcionalidades de seguridad y privacidad que la plataforma pone en marcha para garantizar que su presencia es segura en la plataforma. Se trata de una formación divulgativa y práctica, en la que se les comparten las herramientas que pone a su disposición TikTok para protegerse a lo largo del tiempo que sean usuarios de la plataforma.||Este programa educativo, orientado principalmente a jóvenes de entre 13 y 18 años, además de explicarles las herramientas de seguridad y privacidad, ha centrado su enfoque en proporcionar habilidades esenciales para un uso y comportamiento seguro y positivo dentro del mundo digital en su totalidad. Concienciar en la importancia de la salud mental y el bienestar digital, fomentar el espíritu crítico para discernir información engañosa y evitar la propagación de bulos, o entender el papel de la inteligencia artificial, son algunas de las áreas en las que ahondará estas sesiones.||La segunda edición de este programa, que quiere superar el alcance de más de 10.000 estudiantes de su predecesor, se desarrolla en colaboración con centros educativos de Aragón, Asturias, Castilla y León y Murcia, entre otras. En este nuevo año, Campus TikTok quiere también ampliar el alcance de los talleres hacia las zonas rurales. Esta iniciativa permite que adolescentes, profesores y familias de todos los rincones de España tengan acceso a estos talleres, contribuyendo así a la difusión equitativa de la educación en seguridad digital a lo largo de todo el país. En la web de Campus TikTok los padres, madres, tutores y maestros pueden acceder a recursos educativos, y solicitar talleres para sus centros educativos.||La seguridad incorporada desde el diseño, la máxima prioridad de TikTok||TikTok incorpora la seguridad desde el proceso del diseño del producto, incorporando políticas y herramientas integradas en la aplicación que ofrezcan a los adolescentes una experiencia adecuada a su edad. Cuando los adolescentes más jóvenes empiezan a usar TikTok, se restringe intencionadamente el acceso a ciertas funcionalidades, como TikTok LIVE y la mensajería directa. En la aplicación, las cuentas de los usuarios de entre 13 y 15 años se configuran como privadas por defecto, y se establece el tiempo de pantalla diario de los adolescentes en 60 minutos, además de silenciar las notificaciones a partir de las 21.00 horas.||No todo el contenido es apto para los menores, y es por eso que la plataforma establece los Niveles de Contenido, que como ocurre con los contenidos audiovisuales del cine o la televisión, restringen la edad de visualización de ciertos vídeos y ayudan a salvaguardar aún más la experiencia visual de los adolescentes.||Formación digital integral para incrementar las competencias digitales de los menores||Una parte fundamental de estas sesiones también radica en cómo crear contenido de manera segura y responsable. A través del storytelling, los jóvenes no solo desarrollan su creatividad y autenticidad, sino que también descubren la valiosa oportunidad que TikTok proporciona como plataforma educativa, de entretenimiento y expresión creativa.||En esta edición se ha priorizado nuevamente en la importancia del efecto de su vida digital en su salud. Así, dentro de las sesiones se hablará específicamente sobre la importancia de la salud mental y el bienestar digital, y se aportarán recursos para que los adolescentes entiendan cómo estar preparados||Asimismo, el programa también quiere contribuir a fomentar el espíritu crítico como una habilidad esencial para los jóvenes. El enfoque se centra en capacitar a los menores para discernir información engañosa y evitar la propagación de bulos. Además, se tiene muy en cuenta la relevancia de la inteligencia artificial, proporcionando a los usuarios herramientas para identificar contenidos generados por IA mediante la funcionalidad de TikTok que incorpora etiquetas específicas para este tipo de videos. Todo esto con el fin de poder contribuir a la construcción de la sociedad digital segura del futuro.","{""actions"":[

Esta enorme comunidad se ha erigido como un punto de encuentro para los amantes de los libros, que han encontrado el espacio ideal para  compartir opiniones y preferencias sobre libros … El hashtag #BookTok, que trasciende la plataforma y está revolucionando el mundo editorial, ya suma más de 50 mil millones de visualizaciones y lo que empezó con una serie de videos creativos, se ha convertido en un rincón de inspiración que ha logrado que la lectura llegue a usuarios de todo el mundo.||Además, la cultura española ha encontrado en la plataforma un espacio de difusión que permite traspasar fronteras geográficas y llegar a millones de personas alrededor del mundo. El hashtag #BookTokEspañol acumula ya más de 1.200 millones de visualizaciones, sosteniendo así a una gran comunidad de creadores, autores y usuarios.||Con motivo de La Feria del Libro de Madrid, uno de los eventos literarios más importantes de nuestro país, TikTok continuará mostrando su apoyo a todos aquellos escritores que apuestan por la plataforma como un transmisor de cultura y un espacio de conexión para los amantes de las letras. ||Un nuevo club de lectura gracias a TikTok||¿Pero … qué pueden encontrar los usuarios en  #BookTok? Pueden descubrir originales vídeos en los que se recrean historias, trailers de libros, recomendaciones de nuevos títulos a ritmo de las canciones del momento, consejos de escritura, charlas con los autores, etc. Precisamente, gracias a algunas de las reviews, antiguos títulos como Éramos Mentirosos, de E. Lockhart lanzado hace seis años, ha experimentado un renacimiento, colocándose de nuevo en lo más alto de las listas de ventas. Este mismo fenómeno ha sucedido con libros como La Canción de Aquiles, escrito por Madeline Miller, o El Príncipe Cruel, del autor Holly Black. Y es que, la enorme comunidad creada alrededor de este espacio literario es un auténtico altavoz capaz de situar numerosas obras en el centro del espacio literario.||De esta forma, TikTok se ha convertido, no solo en un punto de encuentro, sino en un auténtico trampolín para los escritores que desean conectar directamente con sus públicos. Un ejemplo de ello es @miguelgane, un poeta español que presentó su último poemario Ojos de Sol en un LIVE dentro de la plataforma, con motivo del Día Mundial de la Poesía, y que reunió a más de 100K espectadores. “TikTok me permite ofrecer un contenido más vivo y cercano, es una forma única de conectar con la audiencia”, asegura Gane, que será uno de los autores que esté en la Feria del Libro de Madrid acercándose a sus lectores, con muchos de los cuales ya ha podido conectar a través de TikTok.||Esta extensa comunidad nos trae otros nombres como el de @raquelbookish, una escritora española que promocionó su libro con el hashtag #BookTok y que compartió con los usuarios todos los detalles del proceso creativo. ||La comunidad literaria nacida en TikTok encuentra espacio para todos los géneros, tanto es así que creadores como @pacohdez realizan reviews de cómics para los amantes de las viñetas o @charlyokei, que sorprende con sus retos sobre cultura general, y que ha materializado en su nuevo libro El gran reto de súper geografía, cargado de curiosos datos. ||Otro de los divulgadores de la plataforma que no podíamos olvidar es @doctorfision, el creador de ciencia que vio cómo su libro El universo explicado se convertía en bestseller. ""Estar en TikTok me ha abierto las puertas a poder cumplir uno de mis sueños más grandes: publicar libros y divulgar ciencia"", afirma. Y es que @doctorfision cuenta ya con una interesante bibliografía en la que encontramos títulos como  La Nueva Carrera Espacial, que se agotó en apenas tres semanas o ExoPlanetas: Vida en otros Mundos, que se publicará en el mes de junio.  ||Siguiendo esta línea educativa que permite a los usuarios aprender datos interesantes sobre distintas disciplinas e, incluso, idiomas encontramos creadores como @mariaspeaksenglish, cuyos tips para mejorar nuestro nivel de inglés han logrado materializarse en su libro 101 Truquitos para Speak English. “Compartí con la comunidad de TikTok el lanzamiento de mi libro y llegó a muchísimas personas que, como yo, usan el hashtag #BookTok para estar al día del mundo editorial. ¡El libro ha llegado a la tercera edición en apenas dos semanas!”, cuenta María. ||Y si bien en TikTok nacen las tendencias, y viajan por el mundo derribando barreras geográficas y culturales, los creadores y autores también han encontrado distintas formas de innovar a través de su obra, para compartir su contenido de la plataforma. Un claro ejemplo de esto es el chef Koldo Royo (@KoldoRoyo), que cuenta con más de 800 mil seguidores en TikTok, y ha presentado recientemente un libro de recetas interactivo, Las Recetas de Koldo Royo, en el que los lectores pueden conectar, a través de un código QR con los vídeos de cocina publicados por el cocinero en la plataforma.||#Booktok, un nuevo espacio para la industria literaria||El impacto de TikTok en la comunidad literaria no solo se ha dejado notar en los usuarios, sino que también ha supuesto un impulso para la industria editorial. Así, librerías icónicas como @casadellibro han llegado a TikTok para conectar con la comunidad de una forma única, compartir su día a día o interactuar alrededor de la lectura, a la vez que aumentan las ventas de algunos títulos. De hecho, alrededor del mundo, ya hay grandes librerías que cuentan con córners específicos para las obras recomendadas en TikTok.||Asimismo, algunos grandes grupos editoriales, como Penguin Random House, han decidido unirse a la plataforma. Con el usuario @penguinlibros, que ya cuenta con 107.000 seguidores, la editorial se inspira y comparte recomendaciones con su comunidad a través de sus vídeos. Además, algunos de los libros de la editorial juvenil Montena (parte de Random House) se han hecho rápidamente populares en los #BookHaul de la plataforma. ||La Feria del Libro de Madrid también se vive en TikTok||La Feria del Libro de Madrid reúne cada año a los amantes de las letras en un evento en el que la literatura alza el vuelo y tanto lectores y escritores se encuentran para compartir impresiones. Por ello, muchos de los que han encontrado en TikTok un espacio para promocionar sus libros y compartir su escritura, estarán presentes durante esta esperada feria, firmando ejemplares a sus seguidores y acercándose un poco más a ellos. ||Entre estos creadores que se darán cita, encontramos a @mariaspeaksenglish y a otros rostros habituales de TikTok como Mara Jiménez, conocida como @madredecroquetas, que compartirá con los lectores su nuevo libro Acepta y vuela.

5713,tt_5713,https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-au/investing-in-our-communitys-digital-well-being-au,"By Jordan Furlong, Product Manager, Digital Well-being||At TikTok, we believe that our digital experiences should bring us joy, entertainment, connection and enrichment. Having a positive relationship with digital devices and apps isn't just about measuring screen time, it's also about feeling in control of how we use technology and ensuring that the time we spend online contributes positively to our sense of well-being. That's why we're taking a number of steps today to help support our community's digital well-being as they create and discover on TikTok.||As we encourage people to think more mindfully about developing positive digital habits, we're launching two new practical tools to make it easier for our community to feel in control of their TikTok experience. We already offer daily screen time limits, which help people decide how much time they'd like to spend on our app each day. In the coming weeks, we're introducing a tool to let people control how much time they spend on TikTok in a single sitting by enabling regular screen time breaks. These prompts will remind people to take a break after a certain amount of uninterrupted screen time, which they can set as they choose.||Our new screen time dashboard will also give our community data about how much time they are spending on TikTok, with summaries of their daily time spent on the app, the number of times they opened the app, and a breakdown of daytime and night-time usage. People can also opt for weekly notifications to review their dashboard.||To support our community in thinking about their digital habits, we've also published a new guide - How can I reflect on my digital well-being with my family and friends? - on our Safety Centre. The guide encourages our community to reflect more holistically about how they spend their time online – whether on TikTok or elsewhere – and how it makes them feel as they set the boundaries that best suit them.||We'll also be introducing weekly digital well-being prompts for younger members of our community. When someone aged between 13 and 17 has used the app for more than 100 minutes in a single day, we will remind them of our screen time limit tool the next time they open the app.||Understanding how parents and teens approach screentime||To better understand how families grapple with the question of screen time, in partnership with Internet Matters, we asked teens and parents in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy for their views on screen time, how they manage it currently, and what help they would like.||The insights from this research underscore the importance of agency – when teens feel in control of their online behaviours and habits, it plays a positive role in their well-being. To help them do that, teens asked for more data about their usage and active alerts like pop-ups and warning times. They also want flexible tools that can be adapted to different circumstances, for example, to allow themselves more screen time during a rainy Saturday afternoon in the summer than they might the night before an exam. Supporting the well-being of young people is an industry-wide challenge, and we hope that others will also benefit from the publication of these findings.||We’re proud that the changes we are announcing today, along with our new guide, will go some way toward helping teens, parents, and the rest of our community, have more agency over how they spend their time on TikTok.||We hope these new digital well-being tools continue to support our community in fostering a positive relationship with TikTok. We will continue to invest in protecting the well-being of people so that our community can feel in control of their TikTok experience and empowered to express their creativity, make meaningful connections and enjoy culture-defining entertainment.||What our partners and our expert advisors say:||“The research showed that younger users would welcome the introduction of built-in features and settings that prompt them to both think critically about the time that they are spending online, but also encourage them to use settings to actively manage the time they spent on the app. It is important that they feel in control of their online experiences and are helped to make considered choices. We look forward to TikTok developing further features that will put children’s wellbeing at the heart of their design choices."" - Carolyn Bunting MBE, CEO, Internet Matters||""A sense of agency is a key aspect of wellbeing in digital spaces. People need tools that empower them to use social media intentionally and to be mindful about how, when, and why they use these platforms. Features that provide people with insight into screentime, and allow them to flexibly customize their online experiences to emphasize quality over quantity, can help provide this sense of agency and support mindfulness."" - Dr. Nina Vasan and Dr. Sara Johansen, advisors from Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation at Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry","```json

While not unique to any one platform, the effects and concerns are felt by all – and we wanted to learn how we could develop even more effective responses to better support teens, parents, and educators.||We continually strive to create the safest possible environment for our community, and today we're sharing more about our work to foster this experience.||New resources to support mindful engagement with challenges||We're glad to see that since launching a dedicated challenges page on our Safety Centre last November, the information for teens, caregivers, and educators has been a place of support for those who need it. To encourage even more people to engage with these resources, we’ve created an in-app guide to house this information.||Community members will be directed to this new in-app guide if they attempt to search for content that we have designated as potentially harmful challenges and hoaxes. Searches for content that violates our Community Guidelines will continue to be blocked, with this in-app guide being displayed instead.||The guide will encourage community members to follow the 4-step process for engaging with an online challenge: asking them to stop for a moment, think about what they've seen, decide how the content made them feel and how they want to act on those feelings.||Engaging our community to be #SaferTogether||As part of this ongoing work to help our community understand online challenges and stay safe while having fun, at the beginning of February, we launched new videos from Australian creators like @demiskinner, @brodiepawson and @zaraliang. These call on our community to follow the 4-step process for engaging with an online challenge. These videos were spotlighted in a dedicated #SaferTogether hub on the Discovery page.||To date, these videos have been viewed more than 18 million times. To further educate our community and help raise awareness of the importance of staying safe online, we're bringing the important message in each video directly to community members.

To help with further research into this area, we're supporting Western Sydney University, one of Australia's leading academic institutions. Alongside monetary support, we will also share the research data that formed the basis of the report authored by Dr. Zoe Hilton and published by Praesidio Safeguarding.||We believe these two contributions will help the Western Sydney University Young and Resilient Research Centre in their interdisciplinary approach to developing evidence-based policies and practices to strengthen the resilience of young people in the digital age.||“This contribution will assist Western Sydney University’s Young and Resilient Research Centre to explore the challenges involved in keeping young people safe online with real world data. TikTok’s support will help us develop research to inform policies, programs and interventions to minimise the risks and maximise the benefits of the digital age for young people.”- Amanda Third, Western Sydney University’s Young and Resilient Research Centre||Making it easier for our community to report challenges||Earlier this month we announced a change to how our Community Guidelines are structured, highlighting dangerous acts and challenges in a dedicated policy category, so it's even easier for our community to familiarise themselves with these guidelines. We're now working to reflect this in our video reporting menu, helping our community to report content that encourages participation in potentially dangerous online challenges.||These steps represent the next phase in our ongoing commitment to support caregivers, teachers and young people. We believe collaboration and transparency will help all of us create an online space that's safe and where creativity and joy can thrive.","```json

6679,tt_6679,https://newsroom.tiktok.com/pt-br/atualizacao-diretrizes-da-comunidade,"Por Cormac Keenan, diretor de Confiança e Segurança do TikTok||Hoje estamos anunciando a atualização das nossas Diretrizes da Comunidade para incluir mais detalhes sobre o que é permitido no TikTok. Nossas Diretrizes da Comunidade apoiam a experiência autêntica e divertida do TikTok que as pessoas conhecem e gostam. Elas definem um código de conduta comum e encorajam um ambiente comunitário acolhedor. Sempre revisamos e fortalecemos nossas políticas para ajudar todos a se sentirem confortáveis ​​e seguros para criar e compartilhar no TikTok.||Promovendo políticas inclusivas||No TikTok, a segurança não é apenas algo bom de se ter ou algo que deixamos para pensar depois, ela é fundamental para todo o nosso trabalho, e nossas equipes se esforçam para serem inclusivas e atenciosas ao desenvolver nossas políticas. Nossas diretrizes se aplicam a todos e a todo conteúdo do TikTok e cobrem amplamente 10 categorias de conteúdo. Esta atualização adiciona mais detalhes a cada área com base no comportamento que vimos na plataforma, feedback que ouvimos de nossa comunidade e contribuições de acadêmicos e organizações da sociedade civil.Embora grande parte desse conteúdo fosse abordado por nossas diretrizes anteriores, estamos destacando algumas das principais áreas que foram fortalecidas para dar um suporte melhor para o bem-estar de nossa comunidade.||- Queremos que nossa comunidade se sinta confortável e confiante em se expressar exatamente como é. Nossas diretrizes atualizadas incorporam feedback e linguagem usadas ​​por especialistas em saúde mental para melhorar nossas políticas sobre autolesão e conteúdo de suicídio e evitar a normalização de comportamentos de automutilação. Nossa política sobre conteúdo de transtornos alimentares têm considerações adicionais para proibir a normalização ou glorificação de comportamentos perigosos de perda de peso.||- Reconhecemos o fardo que as vítimas de abuso muitas vezes enfrentam ao gerenciar sua presença online. Reforçamos as nossas políticas sobre intimidação e assédio e nossas diretrizes agora estão mais claras sobre os tipos de conteúdos e comportamentos que não são bem-vindos no TikTok, incluindo doxxing, cyberstalking e apresentamos uma política mais ampla contra o assédio sexual.||- A segurança de todos em nossa comunidade é de extrema importância, especialmente o bem-estar dos jovens. Em linha com a nossa política de atos perigosos existente, trabalhamos para limitar, rotular ou remover conteúdo que retrate atos ou desafios perigosos. Agora, adicionamos uma seção de atividades prejudiciais à nossa política de segurança para menores para reiterar que o conteúdo que promove desafios, jogos e outros atos perigosos que possam colocar em risco a segurança dos jovens não é permitido no TikTok. Encorajamos as pessoas a serem criativas e divertidas, mas não em detrimento da segurança de um indivíduo ou de outras pessoas.||- O TikTok se posiciona firmemente contra a violência, tanto online quanto offline. Atualizamos nossa política anterior de indivíduos e organizações perigosas para nos concentrarmos de forma mais holística na questão do extremismo violento. Nossas diretrizes agora descrevem em mais detalhes o que é considerado uma ameaça ou incitamento à violência e o conteúdo e comportamento que proibimos.||À medida que desenvolvemos novas políticas, trabalhamos continuamente para tornar o TikTok mais acessível para todos. Recentemente, anunciamos uma nova ferramenta para dar suporte a pessoas com epilepsia fotossensível e estamos começando a lançar um recurso de texto que permite que as pessoas convertam texto digitado em voz que é reproduzido sobre o texto conforme aparece em um vídeo.||Novos recursos para apoiar o bem-estar||À medida que navegamos por assuntos desafiadores, como a automutilação, a compaixão pelos sobreviventes está em primeiro plano. Na próxima semana, lançaremos recursos atualizados para apoiar as pessoas que podem estar passando por dificuldades. Esses recursos foram criados com a orientação dos principais psicólogos comportamentais e especialistas em prevenção de suicídio, incluindo a Providence, Samaritans of Singapore, Live for Tomorrow e membros de nosso Conselho Consultivo de Conteúdo dos EUA. Agora, se alguém pesquisar por termos como ""auto-mutilação” ou ""eu me odeio"", verá ações baseadas em evidências que podem realizar para tentar melhorar o seu humor. Como antes, o acesso ao CVV está disponível para quem estiver buscando suporte emocional.||Estamos também introduzindo telas com opções de visualização sobre vídeos que possam ser considerados explícitos ou angustiantes. Esses tipos de vídeos já são inelegíveis para recomendação no feed “Para você”, e esse recurso visa reduzir ainda mais a visualização inesperada de tal conteúdo, oferecendo aos espectadores a opção de pular o vídeo ou assisti-lo.||Continuamos a desenvolver ferramentas para ajudar as pessoas a gerenciar sua experiência no TikTok, desde filtro automático de comentários indesejados até a possibilidade de dizer ""não estou interessado"" em vídeos no feed “Para você”. Isso é especialmente importante em nossos esforços para apoiar as pessoas que desejam compartilhar suas histórias e usar sua voz para aumentar a conscientização sobre tópicos que outros podem considerar sensíveis.||Desde o início da pandemia, o TikTok forneceu acesso a informações de saúde pública de especialistas em nosso aplicativo e também um alívio para trabalhadores da linha de frente e famílias. Ficamos orgulhosos quando nossa comunidade se reúne por meio de desafios memoráveis ​​- como #wipeitdown e #happyathome - que nos conectam e trazem alegria em momentos difíceis. À medida que as vacinas COVID-19 são desenvolvidas e aprovadas, estamos intensificando nossos esforços para apoiar o bem-estar de nossa comunidade, disponibilizando informações confiáveis ​​sobre vacinas. Ao mesmo tempo, continuamos removendo informações incorretas sobre o coronavírus e as vacinas.||Na próxima semana, a nossa central no aplicativo que reúne informações de especialistas em saúde sobre o coronavírus será atualizada com perguntas e respostas comuns sobre as vacinas da COVID-19. Ela pode ser acessada por nossa página “Descobrir”, em resultados de pesquisas, nos banners em vídeos sobre a COVID-19 e relacionados às vacinas. Todo esse material já foi visto mais de 2 bilhões de vezes no mundo todo nos últimos seis meses. Também estamos formando parceria com a Equipe Halo para que cientistas de todo o mundo possam compartilhar o progresso que está sendo feito com a vacina por meio de atualizações de vídeos.||Educando nossa comunidade||Trabalhamos para educar e capacitar nossa comunidade sobre nossas políticas por meio de vídeos no aplicativo, notificações e ferramentas de segurança. Este mês, quando um usuário abrir o TikTok, pediremos para que ele revise essas diretrizes atualizadas.||Manter nossa comunidade segura é um compromisso sem linha de chegada. Reconhecemos a responsabilidade que temos com nossos usuários de sermos ágeis em nossa detecção e resposta quando surgem novos tipos de conteúdo e comportamentos. Para tanto, continuaremos avançando em nossas políticas, desenvolvendo tecnologia para detectar automaticamente conteúdo violador, criando recursos que ajudam as pessoas a gerenciar sua presença e escolhas de conteúdo no TikTok e capacitando nossa comunidade para nos ajudar a promover um ambiente confiável. Por último, esperamos que essas atualizações possibilitem que as pessoas tenham uma experiência positiva e significativa no TikTok. ","```json

7217,tt_7217,https://newsroom.tiktok.com/nl-nl/nieuwe-functies-voor-tieners-en-gezinnen-op-tiktok,"Auteurs: Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety, TikTok||Vandaag presenteren we nieuwe functies voor tieners, gezinnen en onze gehele community. Volgens ons moeten digitale ervaringen plezierig zijn en positief bijdragen aan de manier waarop gebruikers zich uitdrukken, ideeën ontdekken, en met elkaar in contact komen. Daarom verbeteren we onze schermtijdfunctie met meer opties voor gebruikers, introduceren we nieuwe standaardinstellingen voor accounts van tieners, en breiden we Family Pairing uit met meer opties voor ouderlijk toezicht.Wijzigingen die helpen tieners hun tijd op TikTok te beherenDe komende weken worden alle accounts van gebruikers onder de 18 jaar automatisch ingesteld op een schermtijdlimiet van 60 minuten per dag. Hoewel er geen algemeen aanvaard standpunt is over de 'juiste' hoeveelheid schermtijd of zelfs de impact van schermtijd in het algemeen, hebben we bij de keuze van deze limiet het huidige academische onderzoek en deskundigen van het Digital Wellness Lab van het Boston Children's Hospital geraadpleegd. Als de limiet van 60 minuten is bereikt, wordt de tiener gevraagd een code in te voeren als hij of zij wil blijven kijken, zodat er actief een keuze gemaakt moet worden om de schermtijd te verlengen. Onderzoek toont verder aan dat we gerichtere keuzes maken als we ons beter bewust zijn van hoe we onze tijd doorbrengen. Daarom vragen we tieners om ook een dagelijkse schermtijdlimiet in te stellen als ze de standaardlimiet van 60 minuten willen veranderen en op één dag langer dan 100 minuten op TikTok doorbrengen. Dit bouwt verder op een aanpak die we vorig jaar hebben uitgerold om tieners aan te sporen schermtijdbeheer aan te zetten; onze tests toonden aan dat met deze aanpak het gebruik van onze tools voor schermtijdbeheer met 234% toenam. Daarnaast sturen we elke tiener met een account wekelijks een inboxnotificatie met een overzicht van de schermtijd van de afgelopen week. Deze functies vormen een uitbreiding van onze bestaande strenge veiligheidsinstellingen voor accounts van tieners. Zo zijn accounts van gebruikers tussen 13 en 15 jaar standaard al ingesteld op privé, zodat tieners weloverwogen keuzes kunnen maken over wat ze wanneer willen delen en met wie. Daarnaast zijn directe berichten alleen beschikbaar voor gebruikers van 16 jaar en ouder, terwijl communityleden minimaal 18 moeten zijn om te mogen livestreamen.Gezinnen helpen om te praten over digitaal welzijn Een tiener die begeleiding nodig heeft, gaat daarvoor vaak eerst naar de ouders of verzorgers; die behoren voor ons dan ook tot onze belangrijkste partners. Omdat we ons voortdurend inzetten om gezinnen nog beter de regie te geven, voegen we drie nieuwe functies toe aan Family Pairing:||Individuele dagelijkse schermtijdlimieten: verzorgers kunnen via Family Pairing de dagelijkse schermtijdlimiet voor hun tiener aanpassen – inclusief verschillende limieten voor specifieke dagen van de week. Zo kunnen gezinnen keuzes maken die aansluiten bij bijvoorbeeld schoolroosters, vakantieperiodes, of geplande gezinsuitstapjes. | Schermtijddashboard: we breiden Family Pairing uit met ons schermtijddashboard, dat een overzicht geeft van hoelang gebruikers op de app hebben doorgebracht en het aantal keren dat TikTok is geopend en een uitsplitsing van het gebruik overdag en ‘s nachts. Uitrecent onderzoekweten we dat schermtijd een van de belangrijkste discussiepunten is tussen ouders en hun tieners en wij willen verzorgers ondersteunen met relevante informatie om hun tieners te begeleiden. | Stille meldingen: hoewel meldingen ons helpen om verbonden te blijven, is het op bepaalde momenten vooral belangrijk om niet gestoord te worden. Daarom introduceren we een nieuwe instelling waarmee ouders voor hun tiener een schema voor stille meldingen kunnen instellen. Nu is het al zo dat accounts van gebruikers tussen 13 en 15 jaar geen pushmeldingen ontvangen na 21.00 uur, en dat voor accounts van gebruikers van 16 en 17 jaar pushmeldingen na 22.00 uur zijn uitgeschakeld.||Iedere tiener is uniek, net als elk gezin. Daarom blijven we ons erop richten ouders te voorzien van de informatie die ze nodig hebben over TikTok. We doen dit via partnerships met creators en deskundigen uit de sector, en focussen onze reclamecampagnes op veiligheidsfuncties. Verder blijven we bij bepaalde gebruikers informatie over Family Pairing onder de aandacht brengen in de app, zodat ze kennismaken met opties die handig kunnen zijn voor henzelf of voor iemand die ze kennen. We hopen dat gezinnen dankzij deze functies steeds in dialoog kunnen blijven over veiligheid en welzijn in onze digitale wereld.Nieuwe schermtijdinstellingen voor iedereen We willen dat onze community zelf de regie voert over hun TikTok-ervaring. Daarom breiden we niet alleen Family Pairing uit met deze nieuwe functies, maar kan iedereen binnenkort zijn eigen schermtijdlimieten instellen per dag van de week en een schema maken voor stille meldingen. Daarnaast rollen we een slaapherinnering uit, zodat gebruikers makkelijker kunnen plannen wanneer ze ´s avonds offline willen zijn. Op het ingestelde tijdstip verschijnt dan een pop-up die eraan herinnert dat het tijd is om uit te loggen. Ook in de toekomst blijven we investeren in het verbeteren van onze huidige functies en het introduceren van nieuwe tools, zodat gebruikers zelf de regie houden terwijl ze zich creatief uiten, zinvolle connecties maken en genieten van cultuurbepalende entertainment.||Over TikTok TikTok is het toonaangevende platform voor korte mobiele video's.

We've heard from our community, civil society organisations, and policymakers that this information is helpful to understanding how TikTok operates and moderates content. To share these insights more frequently, we're now publishing quarterly Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports as part of our broader transparency reporting efforts. Because of the nature of processing and responding to legal requests, we'll continue to publish those data bi-annually. ||Here are some of the key insights from our Q1 2021 report, which you can read in full here.||61,951,327videos were removed for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, which is less than 1% of all videos uploaded on TikTok.||82%of these videos were removed before they received any views,91%before any user reports, and93%within 24 hours of being posted. | 1,921,900ads were rejected for violating advertising policies and guidelines. | 11,149,514accounts were removed for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, of which7,263,952were removed for potentially belonging to a person under the age of 13. This is less than 1% of all accounts on TikTok. | 71,470,161accounts were blocked from being created through automated means.||As we’ve evolved our report, we’ve aimed to help the industry push forward when it comes to transparency and accountability around user safety. To bring more visibility to the actions we take to protect minors, in this report we added the number of accounts removed for potentially belonging to an underage person. This builds upon our previous work to strengthen default privacy settings for teens, offer tools to empower parents and families, and limit features like direct messaging and livestream to those age 16 and over. In order to continue strengthening our approach to keeping TikTok a place for people 13 and over, we aim to explore new technologies to help with the industry-wide challenge of age assurance. ||This report also included our first security overview on our global bug bounty programme which helps us proactively identify and resolve security vulnerabilities. This program strengthens our overall security maturity by encouraging global security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose bugs to our teams so we can resolve them before attackers exploit them. As we report, in the first quarter of 2021, TikTok received 33 valid submissions and resolved 29 of them. We also received and published 8 public disclosure requests. With regards to response efficiency, TikTok has an average first response time of 8 hours, resolution time of 30 days, and it takes us 3 days on average to pay out a bounty. ||In the future, we'll publish this data at our online transparency centre which we're working to overhaul to be a home for our transparency reporting and other information about our efforts to protect the safety and integrity of our platform.","```json

With over 45 billion views of #MentalHealth, 10 billion views of #MentalHealthAwareness and 1 billion views of #Wellbeing on our platform, we aim to continue bringing awareness around the value of mental wellness as we nurture a community that feels empowered to connect and share perspectives on mental well-being.||Understanding mental well-being perceptions in Canada and around the world||As we aim to continue nurturing an inclusive environment for our community, we have recently partnered with market research firm YouGov to further understand cross-generational and global consumer attitudes on mental well-being, including people's comfort levels in talking about their own mental health and what can help them feel more supported.||According to the survey, about 80% of respondents feel comfortable or very comfortable talking about mental well-being. Across generations, people become more comfortable talking about their mental well-being as they get older, with 87% of respondents aged 55+ feeling comfortable or very comfortable talking about mental well-being.||There are a few factors holding people back from discussing their own mental well-being. 42% of global consumers are afraid that their friends and family will judge them if they talk to them about this topic, and 48% are afraid that being open about their mental well-being will negatively affect their future prospects at work.||However, there are ways to help make people feel more comfortable speaking about these important topics. More than 1 in 3 Canadian respondents (41%) agree that being encouraged from a young age to talk about my mental well-being would help them feel more comfortable talking about it, and more than half of respondents would feel more comfortable discussing mental well-being if they had close friends (55%) or family members (53%) who had been open about it.||Globally, all consumers surveyed said they primarily seek advice for mental well-being from doctors or mental health professionals, except for respondents from Indonesia and Egypt, whose respondents are more likely to turn to family members or friends. Meanwhile, respondents from South Africa and Vietnam have shared that they are more likely to turn to an online community or social media platform to seek mental well-being advice.||Making mental well-being our priority||Taking the findings of this global study into account, we believe de-stigmatizing mental well-being discussions is crucial as we continuously aim to do more to drive a deeper understanding and awareness of the importance of mental well-being, in collaboration with our global community and partners.||In honour of World Mental Health Day, we introduced our ""Mental Well-being Comes First"" global campaign featuring themed hashtags, tools and resources to raise awareness around mental well-being conversations and encourage our community to share their stories and experiences concerning their mental well-being. #MentalHealth for heartfelt discussions about personal journeys with mental well-being and #SelfCare for tips on how to prioritize actions that bring greater peace.||We are inspired by our creators and partners around the world who create and share content that supports those who may be struggling with their own mental well-being.||We also continue providing our community access to information and resources around mental well-being, supporting empathetic conversations relating to different topics on mental well-being, along with elevating voices of experts and communities dedicated to promoting equal access to mental well-being.||Prioritizing the safety and well-being of our community||We prioritize the safety and well-being of our community as we look to maintain a supportive environment for people who choose to share their mental health experiences and journeys. In consultation with experts, we developed well-being guides that are accessible within the TikTok app, to help our community learn more about improving their well-being. To protect our community, we take a two-pronged approach that involves removing harmful content and connecting people to resources. Our Community Guidelines do not allow content that depicts, promotes, or normalizes activities that could lead to suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating.||At TikTok, we understand everyone has a unique story when it comes to their own mental health - and our commitment to making mental well-being a priority is an ongoing journey. Join us as we continue to bring awareness and break down stigmas through meaningful discussions around mental well-being.||Methodology||Global Consumer Attitudes on Mental Well-being is a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 16,000 adult consumers across 13 markets (United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Germany, South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, Canada, Brazil, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Egypt), commissioned by TikTok in September 2022.","{""actions"":[

We're constantly inspired by stories of our community members lifting up one another and supporting those who are affected by eating disorders. As these conversations happen, we're introducing new resources to provide access to expert help from our app.||Starting this week, when a user searches for #edrecovery #proana or other phrases related to eating disorders, we'll provide access to the National Eating Disorder Information Centre where they can find help and information about treatment.

Throughout the week, NEDIC was highlighted on TikTok’s Discover Page, and their videos promoted to users across Canada, to foster a conversation on issues related to food, exercise, and body image.||To support our community all year, we're introducing permanent public service announcements (PSAs) on hashtags like #whatieatinaday #emotionaleatingtips #bingerecovery and others aimed at driving awareness or fostering support around recovery and those affected by eating disorders.||Celebrating our community||We're proud to recognize creators who are sharing their stories and lifting up others along the way.||Always striving to improve||It's important to recognize moments like Eating Disorder Awareness Week and that we continue this work all year, too. We aim to bring compassion and support to survivors and others who may be struggling or looking for support on our platform. We will keep working to refine our policy against content promoting or glorifying eating disorders, improve our ability to identify harmful content so that it can be quickly removed, and develop creative ways to advocate for our community.

8115,tt_8115,https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-africa/2024-wmhd,"Dive into mental health with Mind Clarity Centre on TikTok as they turn complex topics into bite-sized, engaging insights!||What inspired you to start creating mental health content on TikTok?||At Mind Clarity Centre, our goal is to provide accessible and accurate mental health education. We saw TikTok as a unique platform to reach a wide audience, particularly younger users, with digestible and evidence-based content. Our inspiration stemmed from the growing need to demystify mental health and provide clear, actionable information in an engaging format. We wanted to leverage TikTok’s educational potential to foster better understanding and reduce the spread of misinformation about mental health.||What theme in mental health does your content focus on and why? (e.g Fitness, fashion, medical etc)||Our content focuses on educational mental health topics, with an emphasis on debunking myths, explaining mental health conditions, and providing strategies for mental wellness. We chose this theme because misinformation about mental health is widespread, and education is key to breaking down stigma. By explaining complex topics like anxiety, depression, and the importance of seeking professional help in simple terms, we aim to empower our audience with knowledge and encourage them to take proactive steps toward their well-being.||What role do you think TikTok plays in shaping conversations around mental health today?||TikTok is reshaping how mental health is discussed by making it more approachable. With its short, engaging video format, TikTok allows professionals like us to break down complex ideas into bite-sized, easy-to-understand segments. This platform also fosters a sense of community and openness, where users can share their experiences and seek information without feeling judged. In many ways, TikTok is helping to normalize mental health discussions and bring them into everyday conversations.||What are some effective ways to destigmatize mental health conversations online?||I. Educational Content: We find that factual, well-explained content helps reduce stigma by replacing fear and misinformation with knowledge. Using trending formats like “did-you-know” videos, we debunk myths and provide reliable information.||II. Consistent Messaging: Repetition of key messages—such as ""mental health is just as important as physical health""—helps normalize mental health discussions.||III. Community Engagement: Responding to questions in the comments, creating Q&A videos, and addressing common misconceptions directly fosters a more informed and engaged audience.||Can you share any specific techniques or tools that have helped you manage your own mental health?||At Mind Clarity Centre, we emphasize education for ourselves and our clients as a primary tool for managing mental health. Staying informed about the latest research and best practices in mental health care is vital. Personally, many of our staff use tools like mindfulness apps and journaling as ways to maintain mental wellness, practices we encourage in our educational content.||Can you share a TikTok video that resonated with your audience the most and why?||One of our most popular videos focused on embracing self-love and self-care, which garnered over 45K views. In the video, we emphasized the importance of prioritizing one’s mental and emotional well-being, with practical tips on creating self-care routines and fostering a positive self-image.||What advice would you give anyone who is currently struggling with mental health issues?||Knowledge is power. Start by learning about what you're experiencing, whether it’s anxiety, depression, or something else. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help; mental health professionals can guide you through the healing process and provide the support you need. Remember, there is no shame in asking for help. Educating yourself and taking small steps toward care is a sign of strength, not weakness.||What advice would you give to fellow creators looking to share their mental health journeys authentically?||Stick to factual information and share your journey in a way that educates as well as informs. Always ensure the information you're sharing is accurate and evidence-based, especially when discussing serious mental health topics. Be transparent about your own experiences, but always approach the subject with care, knowing that your audience may include individuals who are also struggling. Authenticity, paired with responsible content, can create a meaningful impact.","{""actions"": [],

Som ett led i detta arbete kan vi idag presentera att vi inleder ett samarbete med ”Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online”, som grundades 2018 av Världsnaturfonden WWF, TRAFFIC och IFAW.

Sedan november 2020 har vi tagit bort 85,3% av allt sådant innehåll innan det fått någon visning. Våra marknadsföringsregler förbjuder även reklam för produkter tillverkade av skyddade djur eller försäljning av djur.||De kriminella som handlar med vilda djur ändrar ständigt sina taktiker för att undvika att bli upptäckta.
